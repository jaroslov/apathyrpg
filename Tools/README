The important parts are the XSL and PY files.

=== PYTHON: Convert ===

This allows you to apply an XSL file to a bunch of XML files at once, rather than dicking around one-at-a-time. I think xsltproc already supports this, but the output-file designation is not automagic. Do ./Converter --help to get more info.

=== XSL: Category ===

This translates the Category (xhtml:table@category) into the Display form. The main function is "xhtml:table" which accepts any xhtml:table whose name is "category". It takes one parameter "style" which can be either "Edit", "Display", or "Descriptions".

Edit -- simply copies the xhtml:table@category in place, useful for editing
Display -- builds a display-table containing the title and table-elements from the category; the title elements contain links to the descriptions (whether or not they exist)
Descriptions -- builds a list of divs in a div, that contains the descriptions along with the title of the element

=== XSL: Display ===

Wraps the xml of the raw information (Apathy.xhtml, all the category.xhtml) into legal XHTML documents.
