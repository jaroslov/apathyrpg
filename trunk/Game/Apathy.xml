        <title>Introduction</title>
        <text><Apathy/> is a paper &amp; pencil role-playing game.
        <Apathy/>&rsquo;s authors have played a great many RPGs including D&amp;D, 
        Heroes
      Unlimited, GURPS, Shadowrun, TMMNT, various White Wolf games
      (Vampire, etc.), Deadlands, and a few others.  While these games are
      all fun, we felt that each game had various shortcomings that could
      be improved upon.  Enter <Apathy/>.  <Apathy/> is designed to be a
      very flexible role-playing system.  <Apathy/> can handle classic
      games with knights and dragons, as well as modern-day, Cyberpunk,
      superhero, or futuristic scenarios.  It excels at fantasy games that
      blend all genres.</text>
        <text><Apathy/> is recommended for advanced role-players (or at
      least for experienced DM/GM/Storytellers).  This is because the
      <Apathy/> system is designed for a unique mix of speed and realism
      rather than carefully &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; rules.  The <Apathy/>
      rules make it very easy to make unbalanced (&ldquo;min-maxed&rdquo;)
      or tweaked characters.  <Apathy/> is likewise not appropriate for
      &ldquo;rules lawyers&rdquo; or excessively anal GMs and
      players.</text>
        <text><Apathy/> was created around several core features.  These
      are what make <Apathy/> a unique game system:</text>
        <itemized-list>
          <item>
            <text><Apathy/> has no fixed character classes, such as
        &ldquo;fighter&rdquo; or &ldquo;wizard&rdquo;, etc.  Players can
        pick and choose every detail of their character, rather than being
        forced into set classes.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <text><Apathy/> contains rules for all manner of technological
        and supernatural powers, weapons, items, and skills for characters
        to use.  These range from archaic concepts like martial arts and
        swords, through ultra-modern concepts such as cybernetics and
        mecha<mdash/>and the supernatural abilities of magic and psionics.
        These different elements can be used simultaneously without any
        one being excessively powerful.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <text>There are no discrete &ldquo;levels&rdquo; for character
        advancement.  Characters develop and grow constantly, rather than
        infrequent, sudden, increases common to level-based games.  There
        is a distinct and obvious increase in &ldquo;power&rdquo; as
        characters grow.  This gives players the feeling that their
        characters are constantly improving as the game continues.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <text>The game rules are purposely devoid of &ldquo;fluff&rdquo;
        rules.  Time-consuming (and therefore not fun) look-up tables and
        thick books of rules are nowhere to be found.  <Apathy/> is
        designed to be fast to play.  Most of the &ldquo;tables&rdquo; in
        the <Apathy/> manuals are just to explain things to the players
        and aren&rsquo;t used during play.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <text>While <Apathy/> is devoid of many &ldquo;clutter
        rules&rdquo;, it does have an emphasis on realism.  <Apathy/>&rsquo;s
        combat system is an excellent compromise between speed and
        realism.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <text>In any game of <Apathy/>, the CHARACTERS are the heroes!</text>

        <title>Basic Terms</title>
        <description-list>
          <item>
            <description><define>Action</define></description>
            <text>An action is the most basic unit of time during combat.
      It is roughly equal to one second of time.  Most characters will
      have three <action plural="yes" /> per turn, though certain things can increase or
      decrease this number.  Note that as long as a character is
      unconscious, he or she always has at least one <action /> per turn.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description><define>Base Armor</define></description>
            <text> A character&rsquo;s natural resistance to bodily harm of
      unusual varieties.  You can think of this as &ldquo;toughness&rdquo; (not to
      be confused with the skill of the same name).  A character&rsquo;s base
      armor reduces the damage they suffer from U (undefined) damage.
      <base-armor /> does not protect against any other form of damage,
      such as P, S, C, or D. Note, that if a character suffers any U
      damage, no matter how high their <base-armor /> might be, they
      always loose at least 1 HP.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description><define>C</define></description>
            <text> An abbreviation for <define>crushing</define>.  When used in
      conjunction with a weapon, it indicates that the weapon in question
      deals <crushing /> type damage.  When used in conjunction with armor, it
      indicates how much <crushing /> damage the armor will defend against.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>CP</description>
            <text> Character Points.  These are points you use to
      &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; skills, equipment, etc. for your character.  CP can
      also be used to increase attributes according to a special table.
      See the section on character creation.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>Character</description>
            <text> A persona within the game world that is adopted by a
      player.  The player sees through the character&rsquo;s eyes, controls the
      character&rsquo;s <action plural="yes" />, and speaks through the character&rsquo;s mouth.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>D</description>
            <text> An abbreviation for <direct-damage />.  D damage is applied
      directly against the target&rsquo;s HP.  Armor, including <base-armor />,
      cannot protect against D damage.  Fortunately, D damage
      sources are few and far between.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description><game-master /></description>
            <text> A person who is in the game that is not a player.
      The <game-master /> controls the game world that the players inhabit.
      He/she controls everything that is not the players.  This includes
      other people (sometimes called non-player characters), monsters,
      natural events, etc.  This is usually abbreviated as &ldquo;GM&rdquo;.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>HP</description>
            <text> Abbreviation for <hit-points />.  <hit-points /> are used to
      represent a character&rsquo;s health.  If a character gets injured, their
      HP decreases.  If a character reaches 0 HP, they fall unconscious.
      If a character reaches -X HP, where X is equal to their maximum HP,
      they are dead.  Note that if a character is below 0 HP, they will
      loose 1 HP per turn (1 HP per 3 seconds when not in combat) due to
      bleeding, unless they are given medical attention.</text>

    see Hand-to-Hand </text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>Hand-to-Hand</description>
            <text> Hand-to-hand is a special type of combat.  It
      takes place when the combatants use no weapons of any kind.  Thus,
      in hand-to-hand combat, only punches, kicks, and similar attacks
      will take place.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description><luck-points /></description>
            <text> Usually, this is short for <luck-points />.  <luck-points /> are
      accumulated during gameplay, and players redeem them for combat
      bonuses, or for saving their character&rsquo;s butt if things get rough.
      This is used to help un<luck-points />y die rolls from screwing over players.
      All major character in the game, including significant NPCs,
      villains, etc. will have <luck-points />.  The GM is responsible for
      distributing <luck-points />.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>MA</description>
            <text> Abbreviation for Martial Arts.  It is sometimes used to
      refer to the Martial Arts skill.  See the Martial Arts section for
      more information.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>MP</description>
            <text> Magic Points, also called Mana.  Magic points measure how
      much magic a character can use in a certain amount of time.  Each
      time magic is used (a spell is cast, or the character makes a rune)
      MP are consumed.  If a character has no MP, they cannot use any
      magic until the MP replenish.  MP replenish naturally over time.
      See the Magic section for details.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>Melee</description>
            <text> Melee is a special type of combat.  Melee combat takes
      place when there are no projectile (launched, thrown, shot,
      etc.) weapons or attacks of any kind.  Melee combat includes things
      like hand-to-hand fighting, or using weapons like swords, clubs,
      etc.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>Missile</description>
            <text> A missile weapon is one that flies through the air in
      some manner.  Throwing knives, slings, thrown stones, spears, and
      arrows are examples of missile weapons.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>Non-Player Character</description>
            <text> A person controlled by the <game-master /> who
      interacts with the players.  A non-player character is anyone in the
      game world not controlled by a player.</text>

          <item>
            <description>PC</description>
            <text> Power Cells.  This is a measurement of energy or power for
      things like mecha, vehicles, robots, and power armor.  Power,
      measured in PC, is produced by things like engines and is consumed
      by movement systems and weapons, etc.  PC can also mean &ldquo;player
      character&rdquo;.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>Player</description>
            <text> An actual person, like the authors of this manual<ndash/>or
      you<ndash/>who controls a character in the game world.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>Round</description>
            <text> A &ldquo;round&rdquo; is the most general unit of time during
      combat.  Any sequence of combat is broken down into one or more
      rounds.  During each round, each combatant gets to take one turn.  A
      round is over whenever all combatants have taken a turn (or are
      unable to for some reason).</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>S</description>
            <text> An abbreviation for <slashing />.  When used in conjunction with
      a weapon, it indicates that the weapon in question deals <slashing />
      type damage.  When used in conjunction with armor, it indicates how

            <description><size /></description>
            <text> A representation of the approximate <size /> of objects such
      as people, mecha, etc.  Humans are <size /> level 2.  Each <size /> level is
      approximately double the height and weight of the <size /> below it.
      So, <size /> 2 covers things up to about 7&rsquo; tall.  <size /> 3, therefore, is
      about 14&rsquo; tall.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>Turn</description>
            <text> A turn is a unit of time during combat.  Each round of
      combat is broken down into one turn per combatant.  During each
      player&rsquo;s turn, they get to do whatever they want.  A turn is roughly
      equal to three seconds of time.  Each turn is subdivided into
      <action plural="yes" />.</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>U</description>
            <text> An abbreviation for undefined damage.  Undefined damage is a
      special type of damage that cannot be prevented by normal armor.  It
      is usually caused by supernatural powers, magic, high tech weapons,
      and similar unusual sources.  Normal (P/S/C) armor cannot
      protect against U damage.  With very few exceptions, the ONLY thing
      that can protect a character from U damage is his or her <base-armor />.
      Note, that if a character suffers any U damage, no matter how high
      their <base-armor /> might be, they ALWAYS loose 1 HP.</text>

      <section>
        <title>Game World</title>
        <text><Apathy/>, like most role-playing games, can be thought of like a play
    or a movie.  The players are like the actors; their characters are the
    heroes and heroines of the story.  Like a movie, a game can take place
    in any number of settings.  The GM is like the director, and decides
    the intricacies of the game world.</text>
        <text>The GM should talk with the players and decide upon what kind of game
    world they would like to use.  The GM can then finalize the details of
    that world, and should tell the players about it before the players
    make their characters and the game starts.</text>
        <text>Some things to think about when creating the game world are the following:</text>
        <numbered-list>
          <item>
            <text>Time Period:  Medieval?  Modern-day?  Futuristic?</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <text> Location:  on Earth?  A different planet?  A particular city, perhaps?</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <text> Level of technology</text>
          </item>
          <item>
            <text> Allowed game subsections: Magic?  Psionics?  Supernatural Powers? etc.</text>
          </item>
        </numbered-list>
        <text>The <Apathy/> system contains sections for many different types of
    games and many different historical settings.  The GM should decide
    which ones to allow for each game.</text>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Creating a Character</title>
        <text>The first step in playing <Apathy/> is determining your character
    concept.  Talk to the GM and your fellow players for ideas about the
    game setting and what kind of character you might want to play.  Your
    imagination is the only real limit as to what your character can be.
    Perhaps you want to play a heroic knight that fights for honor and
    puts monsters to the sword?  Or maybe you&rsquo;d rather play a cunning and
    seductive thief with a hidden agenda.  You could be a young mecha
    pilot<mdash/>inexperienced, but eager to fight for his cause.  Your
    character is a hero in the game.  You should take this opportunity to
    have fun and do things you can&rsquo;t do in real life.</text>
        <image src='/Monsters/Buer.png'/>
        <text>If you are having trouble thinking up a character concept, you might
    want to look to books, movies, or even historical precedent as to what
    kind of character you want to play.  You could be a space mercenary
    like Han Solo from Star Wars, or maybe a secret agent like James
    Bond<mdash/>or perhaps an old-west gunslinger.</text>
        <text>Once you have an idea so to what kind of character you want to play,
    it&rsquo;s time to develop that idea.  Think about what your character looks
    like.  How old are they?  How do they dress?  What kinds of
    possessions do they have?  What do they do for a living?  What was
    their past?  How would they react in a fight?  What would they do if
    they were suddenly given a lot of money?  What are their fears?  Their
    hopes?  Their goals?</text>
        <text>Now you should have a good understanding of your character&rsquo;s
    appearance, personality, skills, etc.  What you need to do next is
    represent that idea in the <Apathy/> system rules.  Grab a character
    sheet, and follow along.</text>
        <section>
          <title>Character Basics</title>
          <text>The first part of describing your character is very simple.  Decide
    what your character&rsquo;s basic description is like.  Are they male or
    female?  How tall?  What do they weigh?  Fill in age, sex, height,
    weight, eyes color, and hair color/style on the upper right portion of
    your character sheet.  Decide on your character&rsquo;s name, and fill that
    in too.  There is also a spot on the character sheet for your
    name.  Now you can move on to the details of your character.</text>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Attributes</title>
          <text><Apathy/> models characters by means of a core attribute system.
    These attributes are numbers that describe the most basic
    characteristics of any given character.  They are:</text>

          <note>Throughout this document the attributes will usually be
      mentioned using the three-letter abbreviation instead of the full
      name.</note>
          <text>The first three attributes (STR, DEX, and BLD) are considered Physical
    Attributes.  The second three attributes (INT, WIS, and WIL) are
    Mental Attributes.  The seventh, CHA, is a little of both, but is
    generally considered to be a Mental Attribute.</text>
          <text>Attributes are rated on a scale.  1 is the lowest possible attribute
    score.  There is no top end on the scale, though an attribute of 20 is
    the peak of human ability.  A human character can never have an
    attribute higher than 20 without some supernatural effect (super
    power, magic, cybernetics, etc).</text>
          <text>When creating a character, the GM allows you a certain number of
    attribute points.  Attribute Points are used to purchase the attribute
    values you want your character to have. A normal human has
      about 40 attribute points.  An above average human would have about
      105<ndash/>140 attribute points.  We recommend that 120 Attribute Points
      be assigned to starting characters<mdash/>after all, player characters
      are supposed to be heroic<mdash/>though the GM has the final word.</text>
          <text>The cost of an attribute is computed like a skill with Rank 1 (see the
    skill section later on). However, the final value for the attribute
    (for a Human) is increased by 8; that is, if you buy 5 levels of STR
    (for 15 AP), then the final value of the STR is <math>5 + 8 = 13</math>.</text>
          <note>In most cases no player may have an attribute below 8.
      Attributes below 8 are considered handicapped and/or disabled, and
      such a character would probably not be adventuring!</note>
          <note>If the
      GM deems it OK, then you may reduce an attribute below 8, but you
      get NO benefits (you wouldn&rsquo;t get points in another attribute for
      example).  Why would you do this?  Simple, it&rsquo;s in your character
      concept.  Would a 6-year-old child have an 8 STR?  Not likely.</note>
          <text>When recording your attributes on the character sheet, record the number of
    Attribute Points you spent on that attribute, this will help you when you wish
    to increase them later.</text>
          <note>No attribute can be above a 20 for a natural human.  A 20 is
      considered the peak of human ability.  11 or so is average.  Below 8
      is considered handicapped for an adult human.  Note that certain
      things can increase attributes above 20, such as supernatural
      powers, magic, cybernetics, etc.</note>
          <text>Character Points (see next section) can be used to purchase Attribute Points
    for increasing your attributes later on.</text>

          <title>Character Points</title>
          <text>The remainder of the character creation process is done through the expenditure
    of Character Points, otherwise known as CP.  Talk with your GM about how many
    CP you should use to create your character with.  We have found that for a
    group of 3-4 players 125 CP is about right.  Typically the more players, the
    fewer CP characters should have.  This will keep the group from becoming too
    powerful<mdash/>unless this is the GM&rsquo;s intent.</text>
          <text>You will use your CP to &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; the remainder of your character.  The rest
    of your character is broken into three categories where you will spend these
    points:</text>

    his CP to develop a well-rounded character.  Note that there are NO skills

          <title>Increasing Attributes (optional)</title>
          <text>If your attributes aren&rsquo;t quite where you desire, you will need to get more
    Attribute Points so you can purchase a better attribute.  Each Attribute Point
    costs 1 Character Point.  Once you purchase the number of Attribute Points you
    want, just look at the table found in the Attributes section above to see
    how many total Attribute Points you must spend to get that attribute.</text>
          <text>You must pay a number of Attribute Points equal to the difference between what
    you want, and what you already have.  For example: if you currently have an 11
    STR (6 Attribute Points) and wish to increase it to a 14 (21 Attribute Points)
    that will cost you 15 Attribute Points (<math>9 - 4 = 5</math>).  Since Attribute Points
    cost 1 Character Point each, going from an 11 in an attribute to a 14 will cost
    15 CP.</text>
          <text>Remember to keep track of how many Attribute Points you have spent on your
    attributes so you can easily increase them at a later date.</text>

        <title>Skills</title>
        <text>All characters have skills.  Skills represent what your character has learned
    and what they know how to do.  Other than being useful in game, skills help to
    distinguish your character from everyone else in the world.  Are you going to
    play a diplomat?  You better have diplomacy, law, and similar skills.  A
    warrior?  Better have that shield and/or weapon skills handy!</text>
        <text>Skills have a number of pieces of information associated with them.  They have
    a Rank}, Associated Attribute, Description,
    and Level.</text>
        <text>The rank determines how hard a skill is to learn.  Higher the rank, the more
    time and CP it will take to get better at it.  Rank 1 skills are the simplest
    and easiest to learn.  Skills that are more difficult have higher ranks.  Rank
    can also be thought of as the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; or &ldquo;price&rdquo; of a skill.</text>
        <text>An associated attribute tells you what attribute is used in the skill roll.
    This is the attribute that is used along with any particular skill.  This is
    discussed in more detail below.</text>
        <text>The description will let you know the scope of <action plural="yes" /> that a skill
    encompasses.  The things listed are not the only things available under that
    skill, but just some of the more common applications of the skill.  If you have
    a question, ask your GM about his take on a particular skill.</text>
        <text>Level is how good your particular character is at the skill. You will use CP
    to purchase levels in a skill, which is discussed below.  If you don&rsquo;t know a
    skill at all, you have Level 0 in that skill<mdash/>meaning you don&rsquo;t know anything
    about it.  The more you know about the skill, the higher your level.
    This is often abbreviated as &ldquo;Lvl&rdquo; (alt. &ldquo;LVL&rdquo;).  You must purchase your
    skill levels with CP.  Below is a simple chart indicating what different levels
    correspond to:</text>

        <text>See the trend?</text>
        <text>If not, here&rsquo;s yet another way to look at purchasing skills.</text>
        <text>To get level 1 of a skill, you must spend the Rank in CP.  To get to the next
    level, add the rank of the skill to the amount of CP you spent the last time you
    increase the skill (and just that last increase, not the total amount you&rsquo;ve spent
    on the skill) and that is the amount that you need to spend.</text>
        <example>
          <title>Computing Skill Cost</title>
          <text>I want to purchase the shield skill
    (rank 2).  To get Lvl 1
    I would need to spend
    2 CP.  Now, if I want to go from Lvl 1, to Lvl 2, I would add the rank (2) to
    the amount I spent on the last level increase (2 CP), to get the new cost, in
    this case I would need to spend a total of 4 CP (rank of 2 + 2 CP from last
    purchase).  So now the total amount I have spent on this skill is 6 CP.  Lets say
    I&rsquo;m not happy with my Lvl 2 shield skill, and wish to upgrade it to level 3.
    I would again take the rank (2) and add it to the amount I spent on the last
    increase (4) to get the number of CP I must spend to upgrade the skill.  In this
    case, I must spend an additional 6 CP.  Therefore, to get a level 3 shield skill
    (or any skill or rank 2), I must spend a total of 12 CP.</text>
        </example>
        <text>If you take a look at the little chart above, you will see that at the desired
    skill level (3) the CP cost is a 6, which I then multiply by the rank (2) to get
    12 CP, the same thing I got when I did it out by hand.</text>
        <text>Note that the chart will only tell you how many total Character Points.  To get
    the number of CP needed to increase to the next level, just subtract the upper
    number from the lower one.  A more complete version of the above table can be
    found at the end of this manual.</text>
        <text>Once you are in game and earning experience, you can increase the level of a
    skill you currently have at least one level in by paying the appropriate CP
    cost.  If you wish to learn the first level of a skill you don&rsquo;t have yet, it
    takes a number of weeks of intense studying equal to the rank of the skill.</text>

          <title>Skill Specialization (optional)</title>
          <section>
            <title>Specialization in most Skills</title>
            <text>It is possible to specialize in many skills.  When specialized, a character
    knows more about a certain aspect of the skill than other parts of the skill.
    In game terms, you are +1 LVL when performing a check in the area of your
    specialization, but are -4 to your roll when you are performing a check outside
    of your specialization.  Specializing does NOT cost any extra CP.</text>
            <example>
              <title>History&rarr;Spanish</title>
              <text>Ralf Gr<umlaut>o</umlaut>osse-Kunstleve is a historian.
    Specifically, he is knowledgeable
    about Spanish history. He has a LVL 3 History skill with a specialization in
    Spanish History.  This means that if Juan had to make a skill check related to
    Spanish history, he would roll 4 dice.  (3 from his LVL, +1 from the specialty.)
    However, if he had to make a History roll about another kind of history, he
    would only roll 3 dice, and be at a -4 to his roll.</text>
            </example>
            <text>Note that you can choose to buy a particular skill more than once with different
    specialties, if you feel like it.  When this happens the roll for &ldquo;outside
    of specialty&rdquo; skill checks is the highest of the skill levels -4 +1 for each
    skill beyond the first.</text>
            <example>
              <title>Chemistry&rarr;WMD</title>
              <text>Dr. Klo<overbrace>tz</overbrace>enstein is a scientist.
    He has LVL 3 Chemistry with a specialty in
    Chemical weapons and poisons.  As well, he has LVL 4 Chemistry with a
    specialization in the chemistry of explosives.  Dr. Klotzenstein&rsquo;s rolls are
    as follows:
    
        <itemized-list><item><text>For Weapons/poisons: 4 dice</text></item><item><text>For Explosives: 5 dice</text></item><item><text>For Non-specialty rolls, 5 dice -3.</text></item></itemized-list></text>
            </example>
            <text>It is possible to specialize in most skills.  Talk to your GM about specializing
    to see which skills you think are appropriate and which ones are not.</text>
            <text>Specializing in skills is purely optional.</text>
          </section>
          <section>
            <title>Specialization applied to Weapon skills</title>
            <text>It is also possible to specialize in weapon skills.  If a character has a
    specialized weapon skill that means that he is especially proficient with a
    very specific type of weapon.  When wielding a weapon that matches a character&rsquo;s
    specialty, that character receives +1 LVL to the skill.  This bonus applies to
    attack (strike) rolls, and defensive rolls (parry), if applicable.  When using
    a weapon that is outside the character&rsquo;s specialty, the character is at -1 LVL.
    Note that Weapon skill specialization does NOT affect damage rolls.</text>
            <text>Specializing in a weapons skill costs 3 CP in addition to the normal cost of the
    skill. Specializing can be applied to all weapon proficiency type skills and
    the shield skill.</text>
            <example>
              <title>Axes&rarr;Nordic War Axe</title>
              <text>Bj<struck>o</struck>rgen
    is a warrior with a liking for the Nordic War Axe.
    He has the skill
    &ldquo;Archaic Weapons: Axes&rdquo; at level 3.  As well, he is specialized in the Nordic
    War Axe.  The total skill cost is 9 CP.  That is 6 CP for Level 3 in a Rank 1
    skill, Plus 3 CP from the specialization.  When welding a Genuine Nordic War
    Axe<trademark/> in combat, Gunnar has 4 dice.  However, when using any other
    kind of axe Gunnar only has 2 dice.</text>
            </example>
            <text>Note that some unusual or esoteric weapons require specialization.
    This is because those weapons are different enough from common weapons that
    they require special knowledge and experience in order to use them properly.</text>
            <text>Most characters that specialize in weapons are very particular about their
    weapons.  For the character it is almost an obsessive-compulsive issue to
    wield a particular weapon.  Generally the weapon must be very specific in order
    to satisfy the specialty.  In medieval campaigns, a weapon specialty might
    require a sword forged by a particular smith, or arrows made from a certain
    type of wood.  In a modern campaign, a weapon specialty might entail a particular
    make and model of rifle.</text>
            <text>Specializing in skills is purely optional.</text>

        <title>Rules (Rolls)</title>
        <text>What would an RPG be without rules?  <Apathy/> has a set of rules that allow
    for just about any occurrence that an imaginative GM can put the players through.</text>
        <text>Lets start with the basics (some of this will be review):</text>
        <text>In <Apathy/>, there are three different types of die rolls.  Every time
    you roll a die when playing <Apathy/>, you will use one of these sets of rules.</text>
        <section>
          <title>Attribute Checks</title>
          <text>Attribute checks are required anytime the GM wants to see if you did something
    solely based on an attribute.  They are used whenever a player wants their 
    character to do something tricky.  Attribute checks are purely based on a 
    character&rsquo;s core attributes.  They are completely separate from skills.  If a 
    player needs to do something based on a particular skill, then see the skill 
    roll section below.</text>
          <example>
            <title>Catch a Pack</title>
            <text>Barnacleez is trying
    to catch a pack that was thrown at him.  The GM 
    requires him to make a DEX check to see if he successfully caught the pack.</text>
          </example>
          <example>
            <title>Swim a Long Distance</title>
            <text>Thomas is trying to
    swim a long distance while carrying a heavy load.
    He has to roll a BLD check to see if he has enough stamina to make the swim.</text>
          </example>
          <example>
            <title>Decipher Symbols</title>
            <text>Wendy is trying to
    decipher the meaning of some strange symbols written 
    on a wall.  Since she has no applicable skills, the GM determines that she needs 
    to make an INT check in order to figure out what they mean.</text>
            <text>Attribute checks are always rolled the same.  Roll ONE twenty-sided die, add 
    the attribute to the die, and add any bonuses or negatives.  If the total (die 
    roll + attribute + bonuses + negatives) is 25 or higher, then the check 
    succeeded.  If you roll a 1, you fail automatically, no matter what your bonuses 
    or attributes are.  If you roll a 20, you succeed automatically, no matter what 
    the negatives might be.  For an attribute check, you always roll just one 
    20-sided die.</text>
          </example>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Contest of Attributes</title>
          <text>Contests of Attributes occur whenever two characters are competing at 
    something that is largely dependent on an attribute and nothing else.  Arm 
    wrestling is a contest of strength.   Racing to complete a puzzle is a contest 
    of intelligence.  A trivia game would be a contest of wisdom, etc.</text>
          <text>A contest of attributes occurs only when there are multiple competitors 
    (generally two) and only when there is no particular skill involved.  For 
    example, arm wrestling is a contest of strength but a game of 1-on-1 basketball 
    is generally not, because basketball is a complex game.</text>
          <text>When a contest of attributes occurs, all competitors roll 1D4 and add the
    result to their attribute.  The highest score wins, and like scores tie.
    The GM may wish to impose negatives and/or bonuses depending on the exact
    circumstances of the contest.</text>
          <example>
            <title>Dougles vs. Enemy Soldier</title>
            <text>Douglas (STR 13) is fighting with an 
    enemy solider (STR 12) over the possession of a single rifle.  The GM 
    declares that a contest of strength will resolve who manages to gain 
    possession of the rifle.  The GM rolls for the solider (a three) and 
    Douglas rolls a 1.  The enemy soldier has a total of 15, and Douglas 
    has 14.  Therefore, the enemy soldier wrestles the rifle out of
    Douglas&rsquo;s hands.</text>
          </example>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Skill Rolls</title>
          <text>Skill rollsare used whenever a player wants to use one of his
    character&rsquo;s skills.  They are also used whenever two characters are competing
    at something (Contest of skills) related to a skill. Skill rolls are also used
    &ldquo;to strike&rdquo; or &ldquo;to defend&rdquo; in combat.</text>
          <text>To determine if you are successful in performing a skill, roll a number of D20s 
    equal to the Level you have purchased the skill in.  To each die, add 
    your 
    current attribute referenced by the associated attribute value of the skill.  
    Each time a die with this value added to it reaches 25 or above, this is called 
    a success.  If you have at least one success, you successfully performed the 
    skill.  Rolling a &ldquo;20&rdquo; on a die will give you +1 successes to however many 
    you rolled normally.  Note that this makes it possible to have more successes 
    than you have levels in a given skill.  Likewise, a roll of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is -1 
    successes to your total.  If you have negative successes (caused by rolling 
    more 1s than successes) then you have a critical failure!  In the case of a 
    critical failure the GM will determine what (negative) outcome happens!</text>

          </figure>
          <text>The GM will give penalties and/or bonuses to your skill roll based on the 
    difficulty of the <action /> you are performing and what circumstances may be 
    surrounding it.  When such a negative or bonus is given, this is subtracted 
    from the associated attribute value, not the number of dice rolled for a skill.</text>
          <text>Basically stated, skill rolls work like this:  Roll 1D20 for each level you 
    have in the skill.  To each die, add your associated attribute and any 
    negatives 
    or bonuses the GM gives you.  If the total on each die is 25 or greater that is 
    a success.  If the die rolls a 20, regardless of bonuses, attributes, etc. you 
    get +1 successes.  If a die rolls a 1, regardless of bonuses, etc. you get -1 
    success.</text>
          <text>Note that the Maximum you can ever add to your die roll<mdash/>no 
    matter how high 
    your attribute or bonuses to succeed might be<mdash/>is 20.</text>
          <text>Also, if you are doing something simple with respect to your skill level 
    then you don&rsquo;t have to roll dice at all.  It&rsquo;s assumed that you succeed 
    examples.</text>
          <example>
            <title>Lookup Internt Address</title>
            <text>Amy has the Computer
    Use skill at level 3.  She wants to look up an 
    Internet address on the computer that she thinks might give the players some 
    needed information.  Since this is a simple task and she has a significant 
    level in the associated skill (Computer Use), then the GM rules that she does 
    so automatically, with no roll needed.</text>
          </example>
          <example>
            <title>Investigate Mysterious Person</title>
            <text>Amy is still on the Internet.
    Now she is attempting to dig up some 
    information about a mysterious person.  The GM determines that Amy needs to 
    use her Level 2 Investigation skill.  Amy has a 13 WIS, the associated 
    attribute 
    for Investigation.  The GM tells her that this is a normal difficulty skill, 
    and there is no bonus or negative.  So Amy rolls 2D20 for the skill and rolls a 
    6 and a 13.  After adding her WIS to each roll, she has a 19 and a 26.
    Only the 
    26 is a success since it is 25 or above.  Since she has at least one success,
    Amy 
    is able to find the information she was looking for.</text>

          <example>
            <title>Fix a Beater</title>
            <text>Chris is trying
    to fix an old car so he and his fellow characters can use 
    it.  The GM determines that this falls under the Mechanic: General skill.  Chris
    has a level 2 in that skill.  Furthermore, the GM determines that since the car 
    is in really bad shape, that Chris has a -3 to his roll.  Chris has a 12 DEX.  
    Chris rolls his dice and gets a 1 and a 16. (Chris is rolling two dice because 
    he has a level 2 skill)  Adding his DEX to those rolls, Chris now has a 13 and 
    a 28.  The 13 isn&rsquo;t 25 or above, so it fails, but the 28 succeeds.  So far, 
    Chris has 1 success.  However, the &ldquo;1&rdquo; Chris rolled is -1 success.  So, this 
    gives Chris a total of 0 successes<mdash/>meaning the car didn&rsquo;t get fixed.</text>

            <title>Shoot a Large Robot</title>
            <text>Billy is
    a cybernetic gunfighter with a 22 DEX.  He is trying to shoot an 
    enemy robot.  The GM determines that Billy gets a bonus of +3 to shoot the 
    robot because it&rsquo;s so large.  Normally, Billy would roll his dice and add +25 
    to each one:  +22 from his DEX and +3 from the <size /> bonus.  However, this gets 
    capped at +20.  Thus, Billy only gets to add +20 to each of his dice.</text>
          </example>
          <example>
            <title>Called Shot to Arm</title>
            <text>Billy is still fighting the same
    giant robot.  This time, he&rsquo;s trying to 
    make a called shot and shoot the robot in the arm.  The GM determines that 
    Billy gets a +3 bonus due to the robot&rsquo;s <size />, but also a -4 to strike because 
    of the called shot to the arm.  Thus, Billy adds up his bonuses:  +22 from DEX 
    +3 from <size /> and -4 for the called shot.  This adds up to +21, but the bonus 
    is capped at +20.  Again, Billy adds +20 to his dice.  Notice that the &ldquo;+20 
    cap&rdquo; is applied AFTER all the bonuses and negatives are added up.</text>

          <title>Contest of Skills</title>
          <text>A contest of skills occurs when two people are trying 
    to defeat each other in some manner with their skills.
    If two characters were competing to see who could sing better, the 
    character with the largest number of successes of the singing skill 
    would win.  The most common example of this is combat.  In order to 
    be successful in a combat situation<mdash/>such as attempting to hit an 
    opponent with a sword while he is blocking with a shield, the 
    initiator (or attacker) of the <action /> must make more successes 
    than the defender.</text>
          <example>
            <title>Tom and the Shopkeeper in a Contest</title>
            <text>Tom is attempting 
    to purchase an expensive suit of armor, and doesn&rsquo;t want to pay 
    full price.  So he is attempting to bring the price down by using 
    the Bargaining skill.  The shopkeeper also has the Bargaining skill, 
    so a contest of skills ensues.  Tom has a skill level of 3, and a 
    WIS of 13 (the associated attribute for Bargaining); the shopkeeper 
    has a level 4 Bargaining (he&rsquo;s been at it longer than Tom has), 
    and a WIS of 10.
    
    Tom rolls 3 dice and gets a &ldquo;14&rdquo;, &ldquo;20&rdquo;, and a &ldquo;3&rdquo;.  Tom now 
    adds his wisdom (13) to each of these.  The GM didn&rsquo;t give any 
    negatives or bonuses, so that is all that gets added.  After adding, 
    the totals are 27, 33, and 16.  Two of these are 25 or higher, so Tom 
    has two successes so far.  Note that Tom rolled one 20<mdash/>which gives him 
    an additional success.  Tom has a total of three successes.
     
    The shopkeeper rolls four dice (remember, he has a level 4 Bargaining), 
    and gets a &ldquo;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;12&rdquo;, &ldquo;15&rsquo;&rdquo;, and an &ldquo;18&rdquo;.  After adding the 
    shopkeeper&rsquo;s WIS of 10, we get the following rolls: &ldquo;11&rdquo;, &ldquo;22&rdquo;, 
    &ldquo;25&rdquo;, and &ldquo;28&rdquo;.  The 25 and 28 are both successes, but the 
    &ldquo;1&rdquo; is a -1 success, so the shopkeeper has 1 total success.
    
    Tom has 3 successes, and the shopkeeper has 1.  Since Tom initiated 
    the bargaining, and has more successes than the &ldquo;defender&rdquo;, he is 
    successful in his attempt to reduce the price of the armor.  How
    much is determined by the GM, but it should be commensurate with 
    the number of successes that Tom beat the shopkeeper by.</text>
          </example>
          <text>The winner of a contest of skills is whomever rolled the highest 
    number of successes.  The margin of success is based on the difference 
    between the two rolls.  For example, if the &ldquo;winner&rdquo; had only 1 more 
    success than the &ldquo;loser&rdquo;, then the contest was close.  However, if 
    the &ldquo;winner&rdquo; had three more successes than the loser, then it was a 
    decisive victory!</text>
          <text>Ties are left up to the GM to resolve.  The suggested protocol is as follows:</text>
          <text>If the tie occurred on a contest that entails a single past event or 
    is something that is &ldquo;judged&rdquo; by outsiders, then the winner is the 
    character with the higher associated attribute.  (Example: who can 
    paint a better picture, etc.)</text>
          <text>If the contest entails an ongoing event (such as the haggling over a 
    suit of armor detailed above) then it is assumed that the competitors 
    &ldquo;keep at it&rdquo; and a second roll is in order.</text>
          <text>The rules for combat are slightly more complicated; see below.</text>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Skill Rolls and Related Skills</title>
          <text>If a character needs to make a skill roll and that character knows 
    other skills that are somehow related to (or are similar to) the 
    skill to be rolled, that character is generally entitled to a bonus 
    to his or her roll.  The exact terms of the bonus, including what 
    skills qualify as &ldquo;related&rdquo;, is determined by the GM on a case-by-case 
    basis.  The general rule is that each level of a related skill conveys 
    a +1 to the roll.  The maximum possible bonus from related skills is 
    +5, regardless of the circumstances.</text>
          <example>
            <title>Paul repairing a device</title>
            <text>Paul is attempting to repair an 
    electronic device.  The GM asks Paul to roll his Electronics skill, 
    which Paul has at lvl 4.  Paul mentions that he also knows the 
    skills Electrical Engineering: 2, Electrician: 3, Mechanic: General: 3, 
    and Communications/Telco: 3.  The GM determines that since this device 
    is purely electronic, Paul&rsquo;s Mechanic skill is of no use.  As well, the 
    GM decides that since this device is unrelated to communications, 
    Paul&rsquo;s Communications skill does not apply either.  However, the GM 
    decides that Paul&rsquo;s Electrical Engineering and Electrician skills 
    are relevant.  The GM assigns Paul a bonus of +5 to his roll from his 
    levels in those related skills.</text>
          </example>
          <text>Related Skill bonuses NEVER apply to 
    combat skills or any skill used in a combat situation.</text>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>All Other Rolls</title>
          <text>This type of die rolling is used for just about everything else in 
    the game: rolling damage from combat, the duration of magical spells, 
    or the number of monsters appearing in a group.</text>
          <text>Rolling dice is represented in the XDY+Z format; for example 
    3D4+1.  This means that you roll three individual 4-sided dice, 
    and add 1 to each die.</text>
          <text>If any die roll with its bonus added in equals or betters the maximum 
    value on a die, then you get a rollover.  When a 
    rollover happens, re-roll that die, without any bonus, and add its 
    value to the total.  If the roll again has the highest value on the 
    die, then another rollover happens.  This keeps going until the 
    highest value on the die is not rolled.  Remember, after 
    the first roll, the bonus is not applied; it&rsquo;s just the 
    raw die roll.</text>
          <text>This may sound confusing, so we&rsquo;ll work with the example from above.
    Let&rsquo;s say you have to roll 3D4+1.  You get some four-sided dice and 
    roll three of them.  Suppose the results are: 1, 3, and a 4.  After 
    adding the +1 (from the die bonus), we now have: 2, 4, and 5.  We add 
    all the totals up and get 11.  Now we have to deal with the rollovers.
    Because the highest value on a four-sided dice is a 4, we have two 
    rollovers: the 4 and 5.  So we roll each of these again, 
    without the original bonus, and get a 2 and 4.  We add 
    these to the total yielding 17.  But wait, we have yet another 
    rollover (the 4).  So we roll that die again, and get a 3.  We now 
    have a total of a 20 for our 3D4+1 die roll.</text>
          <text>The same rules apply for any die.  Lets say you are rolling six-sided 
    dice.  If any die (after bonuses) has a 6 or higher, then you get a 
    rollover.  On an eight-sided die?  You guessed it; a roll of 8 or higher 
    will yield a rollover.</text>
          <text>If you have bonuses or negatives to a roll, add them up first, 
    then perform the final roll.</text>
          <text>Note that if there is a minus to the die roll once all the 
    bonuses/penalties are added up, then no rollover is possible.  An 
    example is 1D4-1.  Even if you roll a 4 on the die it will be reduced 
    to a 3, which does not yield a rollover.  No die (even 
    after negatives) can give a value less than 1.  So, if you 
    have a 1D6-4, and roll a 2 (which would theoretically total -2), 
    then the actual total would be 1.</text>
          <text>Along with what is given above, die rolls might have a 
    raw bonus.  This is represented by a bonus in brackets 
    such as this: 3D4+1 [+4] (alt. 4+3D4+1).  Raw Bonuses are 
    added to the resultant total of a die roll, NOT to each die; thus 
    they do not affect rollovers at all.  This bonus is added in after 
    all the rollovers are done with.  Consider the prior example of 
    3D4+1 but with the [+4] added.  That would be written 3D4+1 [+4].
    The total using the above numbers would be 24. </text>
          <text>Unless otherwise stated, all non-skill die rolls use this system.</text>

        <title>Combat Sequence &amp; Initiative</title>
        <text>Combat is based on a system of <italics>Rounds</italics>, <italics>Turns</italics>, and
    <italics>Actions</italics>.  A &ldquo;round&rdquo; lasts about five seconds.  It is the
    length of time in which all combatants have done something.  Each
    round is broken down into <action plural="yes" />.  An <action /> lasts about 1 second.
    Each combatant gets one or more <action plural="yes" /> during each round.  When all
    combatants have used up their <action plural="yes" />, the current round is over and a
    new one starts.</text>
        <text>During your turn, you determine what you wish to do with your
    available <action plural="yes" />.  Almost everything that you do of significance
    during your turn consumes an <action />   Simple examples of what can be
    done in an <action /> are shooting a gun, swing a sword, moving, or using
    a mystical ability.  Keep in mind that a lot of &ldquo;boring&rdquo; combat
    stuff also takes up <action plural="yes" />: reloading your weapon, moving around,
    ducking behind cover, or taking an item out of your pack.  Some things
    that you will want to do will consume multiple <action plural="yes" /> per turn.</text>
        <image src='/MartialArts/Cpg359-49v.jpg'/>
        <text>All characters, by default, have three <action plural="yes" /> per round.
    Certain skills or in-game effects might change this.  When combat is
    going to start, all players need to figure out how many <action plural="yes" /> they
    get.  (typically, this will be 3 each).</text>
        <text>At the beginning of combat, all characters must roll initiative.  This
    determines who attacks first in the turn.  When combat starts,
    participants must roll a 1D20 for their initiative. If any characters
    have more than 3 <action plural="yes" /> per turn (due to a skill or magical effect or
    somesuch), then those characters must roll initiative twice.</text>
        <text>Various bonuses or penalties apply to initiative rolls.  Certain
    skills and magical effects can alter initiative.  As well, the GM may
    apply initiative bonuses or penalties depending on game situations,
    such as surprise attacks or ambushes.</text>
        <note>Most characters will have 3 <action plural="yes" /> per turn.  All 
    three <action plural="yes" /> are 
    taken at the same time, on that character&rsquo;s initiative.</note>
        <example>
          <title>Tom&rsquo;s Turn in Combat</title>
          <text>Tom is in combat.
    Tom has three <action plural="yes" /> and he rolled an 11 as his 
    initiative.  When it&rsquo;s Tom&rsquo;s turn in combat (11), he takes all three <action plural="yes" /> at 
    that time.</text>
        </example>
        <text>The character that has the highest initiative goes first, and then the 
    character with the next highest initiative takes their turn, and so 
    forth down the line until all combatants have taken a turn.</text>
        <text>Once all turns are over, the current round of combat is over.  It then 
    restarts with everyone&rsquo;s initiative being the same as it was in the previous 
    round.  This progression continues until combat is over.  If the combatants 
    change significantly during combat<mdash/>for example, if new characters show up on 
    the scene<mdash/>the GM might want to make everyone re-roll their initiative.  If 
    something happens during combat that changes how many <action plural="yes" /> the combatants 
    have, the GM should ask that initiative be re-rolled.</text>
        <text>Some things that you might want to do will take up multiple <action plural="yes" />.  A common 
    example of this is spell casting, where many spells take several <action plural="yes" /> to 
    cast.  If you do this, you may need to drag this type of <action /> across multiple  <action plural="yes" /> or even multiple turns.  For example, let&rsquo;s say that you want to cast 
    a spell that takes 3 <action plural="yes" />.  You can use your first <action /> to start casting, 
    and then use your second and third <action plural="yes" /> to finish casting the spell.   At 
    any time you may cancel (stop casting) the spell or ability with no penalty.  
    When an ability or activity requires multiple <action plural="yes" />, it always takes place 
    on the final <action /> that completes that activity.  Also, it is possible to be 
    disturbed or disrupted if you are attacked while performing a multiple-action 
    activity.  The GM should take note of this and might impose skill checks or 
    other chances of failure if you get knocked around too much.</text>
        <note>Note that everything you may wish to do in combat 
    requires one or more <action plural="yes" />.  
    This includes moving around, drawing a weapon, 
    using items, etc.  Undoubtedly, 
    many of your <action plural="yes" /> will be used for things 
    other than attacking.</note>
        <text>When in combat, some characters may want to delay their <action /> until 
    later.  A character can always choose to &ldquo;act later&rdquo; in combat.  
    When doing so the player states what new initiative number he 
    wishes to act on.  The new initiative must be lower than his 
    current initiative number.  Once a character&rsquo;s initiative is 
    delayed it remains delayed (though it could be delayed even further).  
    That characters initiative remains at the new, lower, number for the 
    remainder of combat, unless the GM asks all players to re-roll 
    initiative.  <action plural="yes" /> cannot be split between different initiative 
    numbers.  So, a character must either take all his <action plural="yes" /> at his 
    normal initiative, or he must delay all his <action plural="yes" /> to a later initiative.</text>
        <example>
          <title>Tom&rsquo;s initiative</title>
          <text>Tom&rsquo;s initiative roll is an 18.  He 
    and his fellow players were cornered by ogres for whom the GM has 
    secretly rolled initiative.  Tom has the highest initiative roll, so 
    he goes first.  Tom isn&rsquo;t exactly sure what to do, so he delays 
    his initiative until &ldquo;10&rdquo;.  The GM then resumes combat as normal, 
    with the next highest initiative going first.  Tom has initiative 10 
    for the remainder of combat.</text>
        </example>
        <text>Some game effects last a certain number of turns, or have a certain 
    effect each turn.  These effects are counted and take place on 
    the affected character&rsquo;s turn.  They only are counted and occur 
    if the character begins that turn with the effect in place.  
    These effects occur at the beginning of that character&rsquo;s turn 
    in a given round.  These effects are automatic and do not consume 
    any time from the character.  Resolve all effects before that 
    character takes any <action plural="yes" />. </text>
        <example>
          <title>Lucy&rsquo;s turn in combat</title>
          <text>It is Lucy&rsquo;s turn in 
    combat and she casts Regeneration on herself.  The effect of the 
    spell is that each turn she gains 1D4+1 <hit-points />.  Now the spell 
    has taken effect, but she does not gain any HP yet, nor does this 
    turn count against the duration of the spell.  Now all other 
    combatants take their turns.  When it is again Lucy&rsquo;s 
    turn (next round) she gains her 1D4+1 HP, just before 
    her first <action />   This is also considered one turn out of the 
    spell&rsquo;s duration.</text>
        </example>
        <text>It is possible to &ldquo;hold an <action />  &rdquo; for later.  Holding an  <action /> means that the character is maintaining his current 
    initiative number, but is saving an <action />  for a specific 
    situation.  A character may only hold one <action />  at a time.  
    Furthermore, you must declare what your held <action />  will be, and 
    under what circumstances.  Held <action plural="yes" /> are resolved as soon 
    as their conditions are met.  Held <action plural="yes" /> &ldquo;expire&rdquo; if their 
    declared conditions never occur at the beginning of your next turn.</text>
        <example>
          <title>Tom holds an <action /> </title>
          <text>Tom&rsquo;s initiative is 10.  During 
    his turn he spends one <action /> to move behind some cover and another 
    to ready his longbow.  Tom declares that he is going to hold his 
    final <action />   &ldquo;I am going to cover the hallway with my 
    bow.  If I see a goblin come out of the hallway, I&rsquo;m going to 
    shoot at it&rdquo;.  If a goblin does indeed come out of the hallway (and 
    Tom can see this), then Tom may immediately take his held <action /> to 
    fire an arrow at it.  However, if no goblin comes down the 
    hallway before Tom&rsquo;s next turn, then the held <action />  is wasted.</text>

          <title>Weapons &amp; Equipment</title>
          <text>Most characters will carry equipment in combat.  This usually includes
    weapons and armor.  There are no &ldquo;class&rdquo; restrictions for weapons or
    armor.  Any character can wear any armor and wield any weapon,
    provided that the character has the appropriate attributes and skills.</text>
          <text>Weapons have a minimum strength requirement (MSR).  The MSR
    indicates what strength is required of the character to properly wield
    a given weapon.  If the character&rsquo;s strength is <italics>less</italics> than the
    MSR, then the character has -1 to strike and [-1] damage for each
    point of strength difference.</text>
          <text>The raw damage bonus (RDB) is calculated by subtracting 8 from
    the wielder&rsquo;s Str. The RDB is added as raw damage to
    total of the weapon&rsquo;s damage. However, all weapons have a
    maximum strength bonus (MSB); if the RDB is greater than the
    MSB, then the MSB is used as the RDB instead.</text>
          <example>
            <title>MSR for Bosk</title>
            <text>Bosk has a STR of 17 and is brandishing a
      Hercules Club (3D6C, MSR: 12, MSB: 13).  Because Bosk&rsquo;s
      Str is higher than the minimum strength requirement of
      the Hercules Club (12), he is entitled to a damage bonus.  Subtract
      8 from Bosk&rsquo;s Str score to calculate his bonus: <math>17 - 8 =
      9</math>. So this means that Bosk deals 9+3D6 C damage.</text>
          </example>
          <example>
            <title>Bosk with Knife</title>
            <text>Suppose Bosk pulls out a long knife
      (1D6+1 S, MSR: 8; MSB: 4).  Bosk&rsquo;s Str is significantly
      higher than the minimum required for the weapon.  Calculating his
      theoretical bonus, we can write: 17 - 8 = 9.  At first glance, it
      appears that Bosk is entitled to a [+9] bonus.  However, the maximum
      strength bonus for the long knife is 4. Therefore, Bosk&rsquo;s damage
      roll would be 4+1D6+1.</text>
          </example>
          <text>Bows never grant a damage bonus to characters with higher than 
    required STR.  However, it is possible to purchase stiffer (stronger) 
    bows that can take advantage of a character&rsquo;s higher STR score.  
    High-draw bows cost 20% more for every 1 STR point added to the 
    MSR.  For each point, add [+1] damage.  This can be stacked.  So, a 
    +1 bow costs 20% extra, a +2 bow costs 40% extra, etc.  Note 
    that the maximum STR requirement that can be added to a bow of a 
    given type is equal to half of its original MSR.  Note that the 
    damage and strike penalty for having a lower-than-required STR does 
    apply to bows.  Modern compound bows are adjustable and can be set 
    to a higher than normal strength value without incurring additional cost.</text>
          <image src='/Magic/Lion-faced_deity.jpg'/>
          <text>Characters will have two hands that they may use to wield weapons.
    All weapons are either one-hand or two-handed.  Two-handed weapons, of
    course, require both hands to properly wield.  One-handed weapons
    require only one hand.  Therefore a player could wield one single-hand
    weapon, one two-handed weapon, two single-hand weapons, or one
    single-hand weapon and a shield or other item. However, when wielding
    two weapons the character can have penalties. Also, wielding two
    weapons does not grant the ability to the character to strike with
    both weapons in one <action />  In general, wielding two weapons gives the
    user -3 and -6 to strike with the primary and off -hand
    (respectively), and requires an additional <action />  These penalties can
    be mitigated with skills from Martial Arts.</text>
          <text>Characters that use magic, aside from Martial Magic, must have at 
    least one hand free when casting spells. 
    Characters that use Faith magic must have a holy symbol in their 
    grasp when casting magic; this requires a free hand to hold.  
    Spellcasters are free to use two-handed weapons so long as they 
    aren&rsquo;t wielding the weapon at the same time as they are 
    casting spells.  (Spellcasters can put away a weapon, cast magic 
    freely, and then draw their weapon again, though this takes time)</text>
          <text>All firearms are assumed to be 2-handed by default.  However, pistols 
    and submachine guns may be fired with one hand.  (See rules for using 
    2-handed weapons with one hand below).  Larger firearms including 
    rifles, shotguns, and heavy weapons (rocket launchers, etc.) must always 
    be used 2-handed.  It always requires two hands to reload a firearm, 
    no matter what kind it is.</text>
          <text>Bows are always two-handed weapons.  Hand (small) crossbows can be 
    aimed and fired with one hand.  However, cocking and re-loading 
    a crossbow always requires two hands.  Larger crossbows always 
    require two hands to fire as well as load.  Siege weapons, cannons, 
    heavy weapons, etc, always require both hands to be free in order 
    to load, aim, and fire.</text>
          <text>It is possible to use two hands to fight with a one-handed weapon.  
    In this case, the wielder has -1 to strike and effectively adds +3 
    to his strength.</text>
          <text>It is possible to use some two-handed weapons with one hand.  To do 
    so, add 4 to the minimum strength requirement of the weapon.  Note 
    that many two-handed weapons always require two hands, period.  These 
    are large firearms (rifles, shotguns), staves, pole arms, chains, and bows.  </text>

          <title>Dual-wielding Weapons or Weapon &amp; Shield</title>
          <text>As noted above, it is possible for characters to wield two weapons in
    combat, or a weapon and a shield. A character cannot attack
    with both weapons during the same <action /> unless he takes the
    Multi-weapon style skill in Martial Arts.  A character
    using a weapon and a shield may not attack with his weapon and
    shield bash in the same <action />  for the same reason.  When attacking
    with both weapons the character makes two separate attack rolls, one
    for each weapon; each attack is resolved separately. This takes two
    separate <action plural="yes" />.</text>

              <description>Two normal weapons</description>
              <text> When wielding two weapons the weapon in the
      character&rsquo;s &ldquo;good&rdquo; hand receives a -3 to strike and the weapon in
      the character&rsquo;s &ldquo;off&rdquo; hand receives a -6. Some characters can have
      &ldquo;even-more-offhand&rdquo; weapons, such as a kick (or two), or literally
      having extra limbs. To calculate the negative to strike for wielding
      multiple weapons, first find the number of weapons being used, then
      order them (the strike order). The first weapon is at -3 to strike,
      the second at -6, the third ad -9, and so on, i.e. the k<sup>th</sup>  weapon is at -3*k to strike.</text>

              <text>, or one normal weapon and one backup weapon:
      Some weapons are well suited to, or even designed for, use in the
      &ldquo;off&rdquo; hand.  When using these weapons the penalty for the offhand
      weapon is -3 as opposed to -6.  The penalty for the primary weapon
      remains -3.  Specifically, these combinations are:
    
            <numbered-list><item><text>Any type of knife may be used in the off-hand in combination
        with any standard (non exotic) one-handed weapon in the main hand.</text></item><item><text>Two Kris, or one Kris Datoh (main hand) and one Kris (off
        hand).</text></item><item><text>One Katana (main hand) and one Wakizashi (off hand), but only
        if the wielder is specialized in both weapons and takes the
        appropriate penalty for using the Katana one-handed.</text></item><item><text>Any weapon that is normally used in pairs, such as Sai, Kama,
        tonfa, nunchaku, or Iron Claws.</text></item><item><text>Two identical handguns, but only with the appropriate penalty
        for using them one-handed.</text></item></numbered-list></text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <description>One normal weapon and a shield or item</description>
              <text> If the character is
      wielding a 1-handed weapon in his &ldquo;good&rdquo; hand, and his other hand
      is carrying a shield, a non-weapon holy symbol, or a utility item
      then there is NO strike penalty at all.  For the purposes of this
      rule a utility item is something such as a torch, walking stick,
      magical totem, leash, or bag.  Utility items are not weapons and
      must not require particular attention to carry.</text>
            </item>
          </description-list>
          <text>If a character is wielding two weapons, he may always choose to attack
    with the main weapon only at no penalty.  In this case the weapon in
    his off hand is considered merely carried, and is not &ldquo;ready&rdquo; for
    combat. An attack with the off-hand weapon is always made with the
    full penalty, regardless of what the &ldquo;main hand&rdquo; is doing.</text>
          <text>Note that the Ambidexterity skill from Martial Arts can reduce
    the dual-weapon penalty; and that the Multi-weapon Style skill
    allows the character to strike more than once during a single <action />  A different approach is the use of the Multitarget
    skill which allows the martial artist to strike multiple times with a
    single weapon in a single <action /> </text>

          <title>Combat Overview</title>
          <text>Resolving an attack is a three-step process:</text>
          <numbered-list>
            <item>
              <text>The attacker makes a strike roll.  A strike roll is an attempt
      to hit an opponent using a weapon or ability.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text>The defender may attempt a defensive maneuver.  A defensive
      maneuver is a special skill that is used to avoid or reduce the
      damage from an incoming attack.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text>If the attack was successful, damage is rolled, calculated, and
      applied to the target.</text>
            </item>
          </numbered-list>
          <text>This process is explained in detail below.</text>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Attacking</title>
          <text>An attack is nearly anything that you try to do to an opponent during
    your turn.  Typically an attack is a physical strike against your
    opponent with a weapon (such as your fist or a sword), but it could
    also be the use of a supernatural ability, magic spell, or a modern
    device such as a gun.</text>
          <text>When you attack, you use one of your skills in an attempt to damage
    your opponent.  Normally, this will be a &ldquo;basic attack&rdquo; skill from
    Martial Arts.  Any time you make an attack like this, you roll a
    Strike Roll.  Strike roll is just a special name for a
    skill roll in combat<mdash/>they work just like normal skill rolls.  To
    recap, roll a number of D20s equal to your level of the skill you are
    using to attack with (i.e. use the Large Sword skill to strike with
    your bastard sword), add your attribute and any bonuses or negatives.
    For each die that hits 25 or better, you have a success.  <note>If
      you have at least one success, you strike the target.</note>  Otherwise
    you miss your target.</text>
          <text>Some attacks don&rsquo;t require a skill roll.  This includes special
    attacks that automatically hit your opponent (such as certain
    abilities from Martial Arts) as well as magical spells or supernatural
    powers that are auto-targeting.  For example, the magic spell
    Ray of Heat automatically hits your opponent, with no strike
    roll needed.</text>

          <text>The target of an attack usually receives an attempt to defend himself.
    <note>Defending is using your skills to avoid getting hit by an
      incoming attack.</note>  There are many different skills that are
    available for defense.  They are called defensive maneuvers. A
    defensive maneuver is a special skill or ability that you use
    specifically in response to being attacked; otherwise they work like
    normal skills.  A target of an attack may attempt to use any
    one defensive maneuver in order to protect himself from the
    attack. The most common are parrying, blocking, and the Dodge
    skill.  These are described below.  Other defensive maneuvers may be
    found in the Martial Arts section.</text>

              <description>Parry</description>
              <text> Parrying is using your weapon to deflect a blow from
      another weapon.  Parrying may only be performed with melee weapons,
      against either a melee or hand to hand attack.  Parrying is
      ineffective versus other attacks, such as explosives, bullets,
      chemical splashes, magical energy, etc.  Parry is not a skill
      itself, rather the skill roll for parrying is based on the weapon
      skill you are trying to parry with.  For example, you would use your
      Knife skill to parry using your dagger.  You must have your
      weapon drawn and ready in order to use it to parry.  Note, that this
      is the same skill that is used for attacking with your weapon, so
      most characters will have a good chance at parrying.  <note>A
        weapon or similar combat skill is used for parrying.  Also note
        that parrying is always subject to GM approval.  The GM determines
        the outcome of a successful parry, though it usually means that
        the defender avoids all damage.  However, if you are parrying an
        attack from a heavy or large weapon with a small weapon, the GM
        might want to impose a different outcome.</note></text>

              <description>Block</description>
              <text> Blocking is putting a shield between you and an incoming
      attack.  <note>Upon a successful block, a shield&rsquo;s armor values
        are added to any armor that you are currently wearing</note> (see
      below).  You can attempt to block any incoming attack that you are
      aware of.  Blocking can be used against melee attacks, missile
      weapons, arrows, gunshots, and unusual attacks such as a fireball or
      an acid splash.  Larger shields will make it easier to block, more
      info can be found in the shields section.  <note>The Shield
        skill is used for blocking.  Blocking means that the blow hits,
        but the defender gets to add the armor of the shield to his own
        armor value.</note>  In the case of a non-standard attack, such as a
      splash of acid, the shield simply stops a certain percentage of the
      damage outright.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <description>Dodge</description>
              <text>one of the best types of defense.  Dodge is an
      (expensive) skill; dodging is moving your body out of the way of an
      incoming attack.  By sidestepping, ducking, throwing yourself to the
      ground or similar <action /> you can avoid any attack completely and
      take no damage.  The Dodge skill is used for dodging.  On a
      successful dodge the blow doesn&rsquo;t hit, period.  However, dodge is a
      high rank skill, so most characters will not be very good at it.</text>
            </item>
          </description-list>
          <text>Now that you know what the types of defenses are, we are going to lump
    them together and call them &ldquo;defense&rdquo; for the sake of simplicity for
    what is to follow.</text>
          <text>To defend against an attack, you must succeed at your defending skill
    roll.  And you must have MORE successes at the attacker had in his
    attack roll.  For example, if an attacker has 3 successes to strike
    you, then you would need at least 4 successes at your defensive skill
    to protect yourself.  If you have fewer successes than the attacker,
    you are struck by the attack.  You can only attempt to defend against
    an attack with one type of defense.  You can only try to block, dodge,
    or parry once per attack but not multiple of these at a time (i.e. you
    cannot attempt to block and dodge the same attack).  You can attempt
    to parry one attack and then dodge the next attack, however.</text>
          <text>If you are struck you will likely take damage from the attack.  Also
    note that you cannot defend (parry, block, or dodge) an attack that
    you did not know about!</text>
          <text>Note that there are other defensive maneuvers aside from Dodge, Parry,
    and Block.  These include certain magic spells (Blink, for example),
    martial arts abilities (such as Preemptive Dodge), or supernatural
    powers.  Regardless of what defense a character chooses to use, only
    ONE defense maneuver may be used against any one incoming
    attack<footnote>Some magical spells or super powers of a defensive
      nature are active for a set duration<mdash/>usually several rounds.  Such
      spells, such as full barrier, are not defensive maneuvers.  These
      spells are independent of defense.  A character using such a spell
      may still use a defensive maneuver if she chooses to.  Magical
      spells, martial arts techniques, and supernatural abilities are
      considered defense maneuvers whenever they are single-use effects
      that are used against only one specific attack (such as
      Blink).</footnote><footnote>Some attacks, such as automatically targeting
      magical spells, will strike your opponent regardless of defense.
      Defensive maneuvers are ineffective against these spells.  For
      example, Ray of Heat as discussed above will always strike its
      target.  Call Lightning will always strike its target, if the caster
      succeeds on his magical control roll to cast the spell.  For these
      abilities, defensive maneuvers have no effect.</footnote>.</text>

          <title>Damage</title>
          <text>When an attack hits its target, it will inflict damage upon it.  Every
    weapon has a damage rating associated with it as well as a damage type
    (for example: a dagger is a 1D6 P weapon).  The damage rating is the
    amount of damage it will do, and the damage type reflects how the
    weapon deals its damage.</text>
          <text>Here&rsquo;s a key of the different damage types with abbreviations in
    parenthesis and what they are typically associated with:</text>
          <description-list>
            <item>
              <description>Piercing (P)</description>
              <text> using a sharp tip to penetrate the target creating
      a hole or deep cut within the target.  Some melee weapons, most
      bullets, and other penetrating weapons deal piercing damage.  Armor
      can protect against this type of damage.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <description>Slashing (S)</description>
              <text> using a cutting edge to slice the target creating
      a fairly shallow long cut within the target.  Most melee weapons
      such as knives and swords, as well as lasers deal <slashing /> damage.
      Armor can protect against this type of damage.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <description>Crushing (C)</description>
              <text> using a heavy blunt edge in an attempt to fracture
      or break the target.  This is typically the hardest damage to
      protect against, and as such, is a favorite type of damage for melee
      combat.  Punches, clubs, staves, and explosions deal <crushing />
      damage.  Armor can protect against this type of damage.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <description>Undefined (U)</description>
              <text> using energy to cause damage within the target.
      This can include electricity, heat, magic, sickness and other
      &ldquo;odd&rdquo; types of damage.  Normal armor cannot protect against this
      type of damage.  Only your character&rsquo;s <base-armor /> (BA) can protect
      you from undefined damage.  Any time someone takes undefined damage
      he or she will always take at least one point of damage, regardless
      of the <base-armor />.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <description>Direct (D)</description>
              <text> extremely damaging attacks deal D damage.  There is
      no way to protect yourself from <direct-damage />, as it will bypass all
      armor and other protections that you have on.  Damage from D attacks
      is subtracted directly from <hit-points /> (HP).</text>
            </item>
          </description-list>
          <text>Consider the dagger again: 1D6 P</text>
          <text>This tells us that a strike from a Dagger deals 1D6 damage.  Also, we
    know that it deals piercing damage.</text>
          <text>Ok, so now we&rsquo;ve got our weapon&rsquo;s damage rating and it&rsquo;s damage type.
    Roll the given damage as described in the dice rolling section at the
    beginning of the rules section.  The higher the damage roll, the more
    severe the attack was upon the target.</text>
          <text>After the damage roll is determined, subtract that damage from the
    target&rsquo;s <hit-points /> (HP).  Armor can reduce the damage taken, which
    brings us to<ellipsis/></text>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Armor</title>
          <text>Armor is any covering that you are wearing or behind that will absorb
    some of the damage applied to you.  All armor is given three numerical
    ratings for piercing, <slashing />, and <crushing /> protection.  The higher
    any one number is, the better it will protect you from that type of
    damage.  Typically this value sequence is represented as P/S/C
    (Piercing/<slashing />/<crushing />).  An example would be 3/2/3, which
    provides 3 points of piercing protection, two points of <slashing />
    protection, and 3 points of <crushing /> protection.</text>
          <text>When taking damage subtract the armor value, which matches the damage
    type of the weapon, from the damage amount.</text>
          <text>Here are a few examples:</text>
          <example>
            <title>Carlos vs. the Bandit</title>
            <text>Carlos was attacked by a bandit
      with a short sword.  The bandit made his skill roll to attack and
      had three successes.  Carlos attempts to parry and had only one
      success.  Since Carlos has fewer successes than the attacker, he
      fails to parry and takes full damage.  The GM rolls damage for the
      bandit and determines that the bandit&rsquo;s sword blow deals 8 damage.
      Carlos is wearing soft leather armor, which has a P/S/C rating of
      2/3/0. We know the short sword dealt 8 damage.  But it is a <slashing />
      weapon (denoted by the S in the weapon damage), so the armor
      provides 3 points of protection against this attack.  So we take the
      damage of the weapon (8) and the amount of protection the armor
      gives (3), and subtract the armor value from the weapon damage.  So,
      Carlos just took 5 damage (8-3=5).</text>
          </example>
          <example>
            <title>Lira the Gladiator</title>
            <text>Lira is fighting a gladiator-style
      duel.  Her opponent attacks with a spear and has two successes to
      hit.  Lira wants to block and rolls her shield skill.  She has four
      successes on her skill roll.  This means that she successfully
      blocked the incoming attack with her shield.  The GM rolls damage
      for the attack and gets 14 P.  (that&rsquo;s a strong blow!)  Lira is
      using a Splint Shield (P/S/C of 9/9/9) and is wearing Hard Leather
      armor (3/4/1).  First, apply the damage against Lira&rsquo;s shield.  Her
      shield has an armor of 9 versus P.  This means that her shield stops
      9 points of the incoming damage.  However, since the spear blow
      dealt more damage than her shield has armor, the weapon continues
      through her shield<mdash/>which now has a hole in it.  Lira now deals
      with the remaining 5 damage.  (14 damage was dealt, minus the 9
      taken by the shield = 5).  Her armor has a P value of 3, meaning
      that she only takes 2 points of damage to her HP total.  (14 damage
      - 9 from shield - 3 from armor = 2)</text>
          </example>
          <text>Now that you have that, lets introduce a few tricks.  The entire next
    two paragraphs are incredibly important, so pay attention!</text>
          <text>Weapons that deal undefined or <direct-damage /> (U or D damage) bypass
    all armor values.  Undefined damage can be protected against by your
    character&rsquo;s <base-armor /> (BA) sub-attribute.  Just subtract the BA from
    the damage taken as if the BA was normal armor.  Note that <base-armor />
    is not used for protecting against anything but undefined damage!  A
    target will always lose at least one HP when hit with an attack that
    deals undefined damage.</text>
          <text><direct-damage /> cannot be protected against.  Not by normal armor, Base
    Armor, not anything.  It&rsquo;s harsh, so be careful when on the receiving
    end of something that deals D damage.  D damage is applied directly to
    your <hit-points />.</text>
          <section>
            <title>Armor Piercing</title>
            <text>Some weapons have a note that says &ldquo;AP&rdquo; followed by some number.
    This kind of weapon has an unusual ability to pierce armor.  If an
    armored target is struck by a weapon with &ldquo;AP&rdquo;, the armor is reduced
    by the AP number for the purposes of damage calculation.  Note, that
    this cannot go negative.  If an &ldquo;AP: 10&rdquo; weapon strikes someone
    wearing 5 armor, then the armor is totally ignored.  It does not,
    however, go to -5.</text>
            <example>
              <title>Lira Strikes With Gladius</title>
              <text>Lira is wielding a gladius,
      which is a type of short sword that has AP: 5.  She successfully
      strikes her opponent, and rolls 11 damage.  Her opponent has an
      armor of 7 versus <slashing /> damage.  First, deduct the AP from the
      armor: 7 armor - 5 AP = 2.  Then, deduct the armor from the damage
      like normal: 11 damage - 2 armor = 9 damage.  Lira&rsquo;s opponent takes
      9 damage.
    
      Consider the same situation as above, but assume that Lira&rsquo;s
      opponent&rsquo;s armor is only a 3 versus <slashing />.  First, deduct the AP
      form the armor: 3 armor - 5 AP = -2.  However, this cannot be
      negative, so we cap it at zero.  Now, deduct the result from the
      damage: 11 damage - 0 = 11.  Lira&rsquo;s opponent takes all 11 damage.</text>
            </example>
            <text>AP is effective against armored targets, but it does nothing against
    unarmored targets.  Note, that most weapons with AP don&rsquo;t deal very
    much damage.  It is usually a good idea to use AP weapons versus
    armored targets only, and use &ldquo;normal&rdquo; weapons versus unarmored
    targets.</text>

          <title>Hit Points</title>
          <text><hit-points /> are numbers used to represent how injured or healthy a
    character is.  A character will have TWO Hit Point numbers.  Your
    maximum <hit-points /> determines how tough your character is at full
    health.  This number will rarely change.  It is determined by your BLD
    and WIL attributes, and will rarely change unless your attributes
    change.</text>
          <text>Your current <hit-points /> is the most important number.  It will
    likely change frequently during combat.  <hit-points /> are generally
    represented as a fraction: <math><frac><top>Current HP</top><bot>Max HP</bot></frac></math>.  When the game
    begins, your character will be fully healthy and uninjured.  Thus,
    when starting, your current HP will be equal to your maximum.</text>
          <image src='/Map/Forte-marghera-02.jpg'/>
          <text>As you get injured, any damage you take (after applying armor, etc.)
    will be applied to your current HP.  As you get injured, your current
    HP drops.  Over time, your body will heal itself, and your HP will go
    up.  Seeking medical attention will speed this process.  Other things,
    like magic or cybernetic devices, can heal you as well.</text>
          <text>Your current HP can never exceed your maximum HP.  As a general rule
    for minor injuries (less than 5 HP), you gain back 1 HP per day of
    average activity.  For significant HP losses, it takes (Max~HP -
    Current~HP)<sup>2</sup> days to fully recover your HP.</text>
          <text>If a character is resting and is under basic medical care, then your
    healing time is cut in HALF.  If your character is under the care of a
    professional Doctor or Healer, healing time is cut to one QUARTER of
    normal time.</text>
          <text>If your current HP falls below 0, your character falls unconscious.
    It is possible to remain conscious by making a willpower check at -X,
    where X is the amount below zero your HP are.  If your current HP are
    below 0, your character is bleeding badly (internal bleeding is
    possible too) and you will loose 1 HP per round, unless you receive
    medical attention.  If your current HP ever reaches the negative of
    your maximum HP, you have died.</text>

        <title>Augmentations</title>
    
    <text>Augmentations are modifications to the body made through technology. 
    This can be anything from using a metal implant to repair a broken bone, to 
    replacing a person's brain with a computerized electronic brain.</text>
    
    <text>In general, augmentations fall into two categories.  They are either 
    ADDITIONS to the body or REPLACEMENTS of something already there.</text>
    
    <text>An addition is something that is added to the body that normally isn't there.
    A good example is a cardiac pacemaker.  Additions add new functionality to the 
    body---either as a ``fix'' for an illness, or as an upgrade to the body.  Some 
    additions are very small devices that perform simple functions.  Others are 
    large and complex systems that might require significant body modification!</text>
    
    <text>A replacement is when a part of the body is removed and replaced by something 
    which performs a similar task.  Replacements are usually upgrades of some kind, 
    but might also be used as a repair for a body part that was injured or for 
    utility purposes.</text>
    
        <section><!-- Additions -->
            <title>Additions</title>
    
    <text>There are two basic types of addition augmentations.  The first are small 
    devices that don't take up a lot of room.  These are easy to add to the body 
    because they don't require any power or a lot of space.  As a general rule, 
    this type of augmentation is very small and its function is often limited.</text>
    
    <text>The second type are larger, complex systems, which take up a lot of space in 
    the body.  Generally, the only way to add something like this to your body is 
    to remove, move, replace, or otherwise modify some other
    part of your body in 
    order to accommodate it.  This works on a system of slots (see below) which is 
    similar to the Mecha system.</text>
    
        </section><!-- /Additions -->
        <section><!-- Replacements -->
            <title>Replacements</title>
    
    <text>Augmentation replacements, in their most basic forms, are exactly the same 
    function-wise as normal body parts.  Of course, many augmentation parts are 
    upgrades of some sort.  They might be stronger, faster, or more durable than 
    normal.  Some augmentation replacements have new functions or different 
    abilities than normal.</text>
    
        </section><!-- /Replacements -->
        <section><!-- Augmentation Limbs and Bodies -->
            <title>Augmentation Limbs and Bodies</title>
    
    <text>Entire limbs or even entire bodies may be replaced with augmented versions.  
    There are two basic types of replacement limbs and bodies: Robotic or Cybernetic.</text>
    
    <text>Robotic limbs are built entirely from non-organic materials.  They are machines
    made of steel, high-tensile alloys, wires and high pressure hoses.  Movement 
    comes from hydraulics, electric motors, gears and levers.  Robotic body parts 
    contain no flesh or blood.</text>
    
    <text>Cybernetic limbs are basically organic.  They consist of bone, tendons, and 
    muscles just like ``natural'' limbs.  However, cybernetic limbs are enhanced 
    with technology including electric implants, genetically modified tissues, 
    and some synthetic material reinforcements.</text>
    
    <text>These rules apply to cybernetic and robotic components:</text>

                <title>Robotics</title>
    
    <itemized-list>
        <item> Do not bleed when injured (though they might leak oil or make sparks)</item>
        <item> Have unnatural heat signatures</item>
        <item> Do not look or feel realistic in the slightest; rather they look 
    like machinery.</item>
        <item> Take double damage from electrical sources.</item>
        <item> Are immune to disease, poison, and magical effects that work on 
    living targets (a robotic body part is not alive).  Note that this 
    means that healing magic or typical healing/medical items have no effect on robotics.</item>
        <item> Have double the HP of non-robotic parts.</item>
        <item> Robotic limbs cannot be upgraded directly.  They can, however, be 
    easily removed and replaced with upgraded parts.</item>
        <item> Used robotic parts generally have high resale value and demand.
    Used parts are regularly available.  Many robotic parts are interchangeable.</item>
        <item> Robotic parts are considered fairly easy to replace and repair.  
    Some parts can be swapped in a matter of minutes.</item>
        <item> Robotic parts do not heal automatically.  If damaged, repairs must be
    made by a mechanic or by replacing the damaged parts with new ones.</item>

    etc.) will reveal the true nature of the limb.

             Cybernetic parts can be upgraded at a later date without total 
    replacement.  However, this usually requires surgery.

             Cybernetic parts are usually built around the user's body.  Used 
    cybernetic parts are valuable, but the potential market is limited to those 
    people who are very similar to the original owner.  Therefore the used 
    cybernetic parts market tends to be flooded with supply for which it is 
    difficult to find a buyer.  It is often time consuming to find a donor or 
    source for a particular part.  Cybernetics parts prices for both buyers and 
    sellers will vary wildly depending on market conditions, which are nearly 
    impossible to predict.

             Repair to cybernetic limbs is a combination of electro-mechanical work 
    and traditional medicine.  Repairing significant injuries or adding/removing 
    cybernetics often entails surgery, a hospital stay, and may well require 
    lengthy recovery time.
        </item>
        <item>
             Minor injuries to cybernetic limbs heal just like injuries to a normal 
    human.  Magical healing and regeneration works for cybernetics in most cases, 
    though healing may be incomplete if the damage is severe.

             All humanoid characters have, by default, (size) free slots in the body.
    These are assumed to be located in the torso.  (Humans, which are size 2, 
    start with +2 slots) If you want more slots to store things in, you have to 
    purchase augmentations that give you back additional slots.
        </item>
        <item>
             After all augmentations are chosen for a character, add up the slot 
    total.  This number must be positive.  (In other words, augmentations cannot 
    be installed unless there are slots available to house those parts)
        </item>
        <item>
             A robotic limb may be attached to any kind of torso.  However, a 
    cybernetic limb can only be attached to a natural (non-robotic) torso.  
    This is because all cybernetic limbs depend on the support organs and 
    blood supply found in the torso.

              <title>Basics for Armor and Damage</title>
    
    <itemized-list>
        <item> Armor has 3 main values: Piercing, slashing, and crushing.  
      Armor values are represented by 3 numbers separated by slashes 
      (represented by:  P/S/C; piercing/slashing/crushing).  Example: Armor 
      with values of 4/3/7 would have 4 points of protection vs. Piercing, 
      3 vs. Slashing, and 7 vs. crushing damage.</item>
        <item> Armor does not protect from Undefined (U) or Direct (D).</item>
        <item> A character&rsquo;s Base Armor is the only thing that can protect vs. 
      U damage.  Nothing can protect against D damage.</item>
        <item> All non D/U damage has an associated damage type to is; either P, 
      S, or C.  Subtract all matching armor values of the character from 
      the damage being done.  If the damage value is still above 0, then 
      the character takes that amount of damage.</item>
        <item> A weapon with an armor piercing (AP) attack will list the amount 
      of AP it has.  Subtract this AP number from all of the armor&rsquo;s 
      damage values when determining its protection against the attack.  
      This cannot drop the armor&rsquo;s value below 0.</item>
        <item> GMs determine when armor is damaged beyond use/protection.</item>
        <item> Hard Armor is any armor that uses hard
      ceramic/plastic/metallic/wooden plates or coverage to protect 
      the character.  Hard armor is MUCH more durable than non-hard armor.  
      Hard armor is denoted by &ldquo;hard&rdquo; on the armor sheet.  Note that 
      the components of hard armor are hard.  They can&rsquo;t be bent 
      without damaging the armor.  Hard armor is generally made specifically 
      for the wearer, it will only fit others with nearly identical 
      body proportions.</item>
        <item> Soft armor (armor that isn&rsquo;t considered hard) is at least 
      somewhat flexible.  It will generally fit anyone of similar size/stature. </item>
        <item> Armor with the descriptor of &ldquo;fire&rdquo; has fire protection.  
      This means the armor has the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; ability to deflect 
      and protect against fire attacks.  The armor will protect from all 
      fire damage (assuming the fire hits the armor, so full suits are 
      better for this).</item>
        <item> Armor can be layered, but only one hard suit can be worn at a 
      time.  A person can have different hard armors on different parts of 
      the body.  Non-hard armors can be layered indefinitely.  Add all 
      armor values of the armors together to give the full armor protection.  
      If any armor has fire protection, fire will be stopped, but any armor 
      on top of it is still susceptible to the fire.</item>
        <item> Encumbrance is determined by: BLD/3</item>
        <item> A character can wear (without penalty) as much armor in size 
      levels as his Encumbrance score will allow.  Add up all layers of 
      armor to get the complete Size level of the armor, if this number 
      is equal or less than Encumbrance, then no negatives are given to the player.</item>
        <item> When a character has more armor than his Encumbrance (ENC) 
      allows, then the player has the following penalties against him:
            <itemized-list>
                <item> -2 DEX per pt over ENC</item>
                <item> -1 action per 2 full points over ENC</item>
            </itemized-list>
        </item>
        <item> An armor&rsquo;s Class is a general idea of what period of history/future 
      the armor would appear.  A later period can find the earlier armor.</item>

    <itemized-list>
        <item> When creating a shield, there are 2 factors.  The material the 
      shield is made of, and the type of shield.  Choose both of these 
      values when creating a shield to get the full set of statistics 
      for the shield.
        </item>
        <item> On a successful block, a shield will subtract its appropriate 
      armor value from the damage.  Any damage that penetrates the shield 
      will then be applied against the user&rsquo;s armor.
        </item>
        <item> Shields can be used to block U attacks that are &ldquo;thrown&rdquo; 
      at them.  These include fireballs, lightning strikes, breath 
      weapons, chemical splashes, etc.  To block one of these attacks, 
      the user must make a block roll at -3.  If successful, then damage 
      will be reduced based on the type of shield:

            <title>Energy Weapons</title>
            <text>
    Most energy weapons are powered by a battery pack.  These are interchangable between weapons.  Energy within the packs is consumed as the weapon is fired, like normal bullets.  They are called &ldquo;batts&rdquo; or &ldquo;b-paks&rdquo; in slang. B-paks store energy in units of EU.  Different weapons consume EU at different rates.  Smaller weapons use 1 EU per shot.  Larger weapons might use more.  Pistols can hold ONE pack.  Rifles/cannons can usually hold 3. B-paks can be recharged.  Recharging a pack takes about thirty seconds per EU that has been used.  As a general rule, it costs $1 per EU to have pack recharged.  HD paks require special equipment to charge and these cost about $1.50 per EU to charge.

    For damage type listed as _/_, the weapon can deal either type of
    damage for a given attack.  For a P/S weapon, the attcker can choose
    to do a P or S attack. For every point of STR under Min. STR, the
    attack gets -1 damage and -2 to strike/parry. STR Req is the minimum
    strength required to wield the weapon. For every point of STR over the
    Strength Requirement, add one point of damage to the raw roll, up to a
    maximum of the MSB (Max Strength Bonus) A raw bonus is always
    indicated with square brackets.  So 3D4+1 [+4] would be a normal 3D4+1
    roll, with an additional 4 added to the final result. When wielding a
    1-H weapon with two hands, assume the wielder has +2 STR.

    The Monofilament Whip is length of metallic, diamondoid, or silicoid wire that is the thickness of a single molecule, with a weight on one end.	The Archaic Weapon<mdash />Chain skill is used.  A skill roll of 4 or less is considered a critical failure (instead of the normal 1). This modified critical failure is there for people who are skilled.  Those who are not get a critical failure on a 9 or below.

    The recover time of the Monofilament Whip cannot be reduced by strength, and will always require a 1 action to recover from safely. The user can attempt to reduce the recover time to 0, but there is a 50% chance that the user will strike himself with the	whip dealing full damage to himself.

                <title>Notes: specific to Plasma Weapons</title>
    
                <itemized-list>
                  <item>Plasma weapons are a bladeless handle (typically looks like a
      normal weapon handle or a flashlight) from which a glowing blade of
      extremely hot plasma vents forth.  The plasma is held in the shape
      of a cylinder (or blade) by a magnetic field. They take an action to
      turn on.</item>
                  <item>Due to the difference between using a plasma weapon verses
      normal weapons, they require the Archaic Weapons - Energy skill to
      use. Anyone can use their normal sword skill (or axe skill
      respectively) but will get a critical failure on a 4 or below
      (instead of the normal 1).</item>
                  <item>Plasma weapons cannot be parried by non-plasma weapons,
      likewise, they cannot parry non-plasma weapons.  Similarly, shields
      cannot block plasma weapons.  Plasma weapons can parry other plasma
      weapons, and force fields protect against them as normal If a plasma
      weapon comes in contact with another one, there is a 25% chance the
      magnetic fields of the blades will lock together. It is easy to tell
      if combatants are locked as an extremely bright glow emanates from
      the contact point of the weapons. Getting out of a lock requires an
      action where a strength contest ensues.  If there is more than a
      difference of 8 between the two strength rolls, the lock is broken
      and the loser loses his or her next action.  If no break occurs, the
      combatants must attempt again on the next action. Either combatant
      in a lock can turn off their weapon, in which case he or she
      automatically loses the lock challenge, and gets the same negative
      as if he lost due in a STR contest.</item>
                  <item>One side effect of having a magnetic field around the blade, is

    Rocket-assisted weapons are modern versions of traditional archaic weapons.  They have small rocket motors contained in the weapon.	When the weapon is swung,  the motor ignites, giving extra force to the blow.  They are used with the same skill as normal archaic weapons.

              <text>
    If such a weapon is used, and the target is missed, then it takes an extra two actions to recover.  If the target is hit but the blow	is parried or blocked, then it takes the normal time to recover.
              </text>
    
              <text>
    When using rocket assisted weapons, you need an extra success to parry melee attacks.  (At least two better than attacker.)

              <text>
    Each weapon can store up to 5 &ldquo;rocket charges.&rdquo;  When these are used up, they must be refilled before the weapon can be used.	Each charge costs $100 to refill.

      Magic exists in many forms.  It is a supernatural energy that
      permeates everything in the world.  Characters with the right skills
      can bend this energy to their will<mdash />and perform amazing feats in the
      process.  Magic is capable of healing the sick, raising the dead,
      creating a great fireball, protecting the caster from harm<mdash />and
      nearly anything else you can imagine.
        </text>
      
        <text>
      Magic, whatever type it might be, is all about manipulating MANA.
      Mana, as mentioned above, is a supernatural energy that is present in
      everything.  It is in the air, the ground, in your food, even in your
      body.  Mana is what is responsible for &ldquo;enforcing&rdquo; physical laws
      such as gravity, etc.  When a person uses magic, they are manipulating
      mana to do what they want.  Normally, this is the mana that is in
      their own body.  It is possible to work with mana outside one&rsquo;s body
      as well.  Nobody really knows exactly how mana works, but special
      gestures and body movements handed down throughout time are believed
      to initiate complex quantum-mechanical events that result in seemingly
      impossible things taking place<mdash />magic.
        </text>
      
        <text>
      Mana is found in all things.  However, more mana is found in some
      things than others.  Gases (air, for example) have very little mana.
      Denser substances such as water and stone have more mana.  Complex
      things such as man-made objects (pottery, woodcarvings, machinery,
      etc.) contain quite a lot of mana.  Living things, from mice to humans
      to whales, contain even more mana.  Mana is released back into the
      environment when living things die, or when mana-rich objects decay,
      are burned, or broken.  Other objects tend to &ldquo;soak up&rdquo; mana that is
      released near them.  Thus, older items tend to contain more mana than
      do &ldquo;new&rdquo; ones.  Whenever an item is broken it is possible to extract
      some of its mana as it dissipates back into the environment.  This is
      also possible when a living creature dies.  In game terms, we call
      mana &ldquo;MP&rdquo; (Mana Points / Magic Points).

          <title>Invocation Magic (spellcasting)</title>
      
          <text>
      Invocation spellcasting is the most common and basic form of magic.
      This is the art of the wizard and sorceress, where characters use
      innate mana to cast spells.  Invocation spells are based on
      methodical, practiced, gestures and chanting of magical incantations.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Incantation magic is learned.  The invocation magician will have a
      list of spells that she has studied and memorized.  As long as she has
      mana (MP) available, she may cast any spell that she knows.  Because
      invocation magicians use innate mana and well defined, repeatable,
      forms it is the easiest type of magic to learn.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Spells are learned from other magicians, studious research, or a
      combination of the two.  Research requires access to various books on
      the subject of magic, including book(s) that are specifically about
      the spell to be learned.  True books on magical subjects are few and
      far between, and books about high level spells are extremely valuable.
      Invocation magicians have invented a special language to record and
      describe magic spells and the procedures required to cast them.  All
      true magical books will be written, at least in part, in this
      special language.  Wizards and Sorceresses might hail from different
      countries, races, and moral standpoints<mdash />but they all share common
      ground in the ability to read magical script.  Magical script is
      specially designed to describe and transcribe magical spells,
      therefore it is rarely used for other purposes.  It is difficult to
      carry on a conversation, written or spoken, in the language of magic.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      More often than not a wizard will belong to a particular clan or
      school, where many wizards pool their knowledge and references for
      members to share.  In such situations there will usually be more
      experienced spellcasters that may teach their skills to junior
      members.  Wizards may be children of existing wizards or they might be
      apprentices or students at an established wizard&rsquo;s school or place of
      business.  Wizard secret societies are common as well.  Some are
      devoted to particular schools of magic.  Others are devoted to a
      certain cause and happen to share arcane secrets to persue common
      goals.  Wizard secret societies and wizard schools are places where
      other wizards can learn new spells and find magical items.  However,
      most magic secret societies have a strict hierarchy and code of
      conduct.  Special oaths, tithes, and obedience to the order are often
      required, and favors always entail repayment.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Spells are purchased (learned) similar to skills.  However, there are
      no levels for spells.  A character either knows a given spell, or they
      don&rsquo;t.  If you like you can think of this as a &ldquo;level 1 skill&rdquo;.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      There exist different schools (aka categories) of magic.  Some Wizards
      specialize in certain schools, but that is purely optional.  Any
      character may learn spells from any category<mdash />but with the following
      restrictions.  A character may only learn a given spell if she knows
      at least one spell of lower rank from the same school.  As well, the
      rank of the spell must be no higher than your <spellcasting />
      skill level.  For example, you cannot learn a rank 4 &ldquo;Air&rdquo; magic
      spell unless you already know a rank 3 &ldquo;Air&rdquo; spell, AND you must
      have Level 4 or higher <spellcasting />.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      You can learn any spell, regardless of type, if you have a
      spellcasting skill at least three levels higher than the rank of the
      spell.  For example, if you have a spellcasting skill level of 6, then
      you could learn any spell of rank 3 or lower, regardless of school or
      prerequisite lower-rank spell.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      A character with level 1 or higher spellcasting can always learn Rank
      1 magical spells from any school without restriction.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Note that a Wizard or Sorceress character must have at least one level
      in Magical Studies in order to read spell books and to learn the
      intonations required for magical incantations.  Beyond that Magical
      Studies is a purely optional skill.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Characters that cast Invocation magic must have at least two free
      points of Encumberance available.  If not, they are not able to cast
      magic.

        <section><!-- Ritual Magic -->
          <title>Ritual Magic</title>
      
          <text>
      Ritual magic is performed in elaborate &ldquo;performances&rdquo; involving a
      much human involvement.  Magic rituals involve material components
      (ingredients) and a great deal of chanting, mumbling, gesturing, and
      the like.  The traditional image of a witch, bent over a bubbling
      cauldron containing newt eyes and salamander toenails is a good
      example of ritual magic.  Whereas traditional spellcasting is an
      almost scientific pursuit, ritual magic is more of an art. Rituals are
      conducted with a trained eye and experience.  Because ritual
      ingredients vary in quality and potency, precision has little
      use. Ritual magicians are shamans, witches and warlocks.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Ritual magic is not religious.  In fact, it is no more religious than
      making a bowl of oatmeal or mixing some cement.  However, in many
      cultures ritual magic is heavily associated with religion, especially
      in primitive, animistic, or tribal societies.  In these cultures
      ritual magic is the domain of the &ldquo;witch doctor&rdquo; or &ldquo;medicine
      man&rdquo;<mdash />people who hold important positions in the tribe, often
      including that of a kind of priest or spiritual leader.  Therefore,
      there is a strong association between ritual magic and primitive,
      pagan, religions.  Many ritual magicians are religious figures,
      members of mysterious cults, etc.  Some ritual magicians have been
      known to practice animal or even human sacrifice (an excellent, though
      horrific, source of MP for rituals).  In these societies ritual magic
      is often believed to be religious in nature despite the fact that it
      is decidedly not.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Ritual magic users do not use innate MP to perform magic.  Rather,
      they use material components (ingredients) to create magical effects.
      Performing rituals requires a large amount of space and various
      supplies and components. Ritual preparation and casting is a time
      consuming and often messy proposition.  Therefore, most ritualists
      have a set area where they can store their materials and perform
      rituals: usually a quiet location away from prying eyes.  This might
      be a purpose-built room in the home or a secret &ldquo;lair&rdquo; in a basement
      or abandoned building.  It might even be a cave or hidden woodland
      grotto.  Such an area is a very personal space for the ritualist, and
      while it might be neatly organized or highly messy, it will be arrayed
      exactly how its owner prefers.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Most ritual supplies are re-useable, and a ritualist&rsquo;s &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo;
      will be well stocked with such items.  These include such things as
      wands, knives, scales, measuring devices, a fireplace, cauldrons,
      bottles, pots, strainers, mirrors, precious gems, candles, assorted
      tools, and so on.  Approximately $1000 * Rank worth of supplies is
      required in a ritualist&rsquo;s &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo;.  (In other words, in order to
      perform the Ritual Stoneform, which is a rank 6 spell, $6000 worth of
      supplies are required to be on hand) These supplies are reuseable and
      are used for many different rituals.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Specific spells require different ingredients.  Ingredients could be
      nearly anything, including herbs and roots, body parts (animal and
      human), minerals, chemicals, plants, and so forth.  Some of these are
      common and will be used for many different spells.  Others are quite
      specific and rare, and have very specific applications.  A ritualist
      will usually have a personal stockpile of ingredients and components
      stored away.  This stockpile will usually include all but the most
      expensive of components.  Of course, some components can be difficult
      to find and some must be fresh, so any ritualist will definately have
      the means to locate components that she needs.  Some components might
      be gathered personally, through the use of skills such as herbalism,
      alchemy, hunting, or scrounging.  Other components are purchased by
      the ritualist.  Some components may be purchased at common merchants
      while others must be purchased from special (and sometimes illicit)
      vendors.  Most ritualists will have known connections through which
      different components and supplies might be shared, purchased, or
      loaned.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      The cost of ingredients for a particular spell is approximately 1/10
      of the &ldquo;scroll or potion&rdquo; cost from the spell chart. This assumes
      fair prices in an open market.  However, this cost might vary greatly
      depending on various circumstances.  For example, in a certain town
      components for Fire spells might be common and therefore very
      inexpensive, while components for Earth spells might be rare and
      therefore much more expensive.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      In addition to its specific &ldquo;recipe&rdquo;, any ritual spell will also
      require the infusion of mana.  As mentioned above, in ritual magic the
      MP does not come from the caster.  The caster must gather objects
      containing sufficient MP to conduct the spell.  As mentioned above,
      mana is present in nearly everything, but generally not in sufficient
      quantity to do any good.  Therefore, the ritualist must seek out items
      that are rich in MP to use when conducting a ritual.  This process
      results in the destruction of the items used!  This might even entail
      the sacrifice of living things<mdash />if such an amount of MP is required.
      Generally, items yielding MP for ritual use will cost about $1 per MP
      required, though this will vary.  Much like individual spell
      components, a ritualist will tend to hoard items that may be
      sacrificed for MP.  Common items are living plants and small animals,
      antiques, old artwork, fossils, old holy items, old clothing
      (especially from special occasions) and well-used household goods.
      MP-source items are not spell-dependant.  MP items can be used for ANY
      spell.

      Ritual magicians may also perform a ritual in a special manner,
      infusing the spell into an object, such as a weapon or magical totem.
      Infusing a spell takes the same amount of time as performing the
      ritual in normal fashion.  Once the spell is infused in an item, it
      may be released very quickly.  Releasing a charge (the energy and
      magical effects of a stored ritual) requires 1 action, regardless of
      the original casting time of the spell.  Infused ritual items are only
      good for twenty-four hours, at which point the charge is lost and the
      item returns to normal.  The ritualist may create charges of extended
      duration when he first performs the infusion, but each 24 hours of
      time requires another batch of the requisite spell ingredients (not
      Mana).  Therefore, it can become very expensive to make long duration
      infused items.  An infused item may be used by anyone, not just the
      ritualist.

          <text>
      Religious magic is magical effects that are brought into reality by
      the combined will of the caster and the caster&rsquo;s god(s).  Whereas
      primitive religions and cults tend towards the use of ritual magic,
      Religious or Faith magic is practiced by priests of clearly defined
      and well organized religions.  Most religions that practice Faith
      magic have a clearly organized hierarchy within the church.  Religious
      dogma and/or scripture is well defined and is extensively documented.
      Faith-magic using religions are not necessarily &ldquo;good&rdquo;, but they are
      usually known to the general public and often actively recruit new
      members.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Religious magic is taught by a particular Church. Each faith has one
      or more magic schools associated with it.  These nearly always include
      <Spiritual /> and <Life /> magic, and may include others.  Most
      faiths have 3 or 4 schools of spells.  A faith caster has access to
      all spells in the school(s) associated with his <faith />, except
      those whose rank is higher than his level of faith, and those which
      are specifically prohibited by his Church.  For example, a &ldquo;good&rdquo;
      tending religion would typically deny harmful <Life />-magic spells
      to their adherents, for example curse.

          <text>
      Priests, monks, and warriors of faith practice religious magic.  All
      religious spells are channeled through a holy symbol (see below).
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Once a day the caster must engage in prayer.  The exact means of
      praying is left up to the players &amp; GM, but during this time the
      priest will choose which spells he as access to for the remainder of
      the day.  The caster may choose any combination of spells he has
      access to, provided that he has enough MP (at the time of prayer) for
      that particular combination.  The caster must allocate MP and spells
      during this prayer session.  Until the next prayer session those are
      the spells the caster may use.  A holy symbol of at least +0 quality
      is required for this prayer, otherwise the caster cannot allocate
      spells for that day.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      A faith magic user always uses the <faith /> skill for any and all
      magic-related skill rolls, including those that would normally require
      <spellcasting /> or <magical-control />, etc.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      A <holy-symbol /> is always required to cast <faith /> magic.
      If a holy symbol is not available, then Faith magic simply cannot be
      cast.  Thankfully, a simple gesture or trinket often suffices.  There
      are different types of holy symbols.  &ldquo;Better&rdquo; and more significant
      holy symbols offer a better bonus to Faith magic casting:

          <title>Martial Magic / Super Power Combat</title>
      
          <text>
      Martial magic is the ability to perform supernatural &ldquo;attacks&rdquo; in
      conjunction with normal combat, such as fist fighting, martial arts,
      or combat with weapons.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Martial Magic always works in conjunction with some kind of verbal or
      somatic component.  This means that the fighter must perform a
      particular combat form (kata), stance, or must shout a particular
      phrase in order to use the ability.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Martial magic is always taught from master to student.  It is a
      closely guarded secret of warrior secret societies, secluded martial
      arts temples, or families with great fighting traditions.  Once a
      warrior masters the traditional (non-supernatural) combat arts, he may
      be taught martial magic.  Since martial magic is highly dependent on
      particular combat forms and stances, it is nearly impossible to learn
      on one&rsquo;s own or from a book.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Magical effects that ordinarily require touch do so for the martial
      magician as well.  This is normally done by striking the target with
      some kind of melee attack.  The character does not have to deal damage
      per se (if the target is wearing armor) but he must connect with a
      solid blow.  The magical energy (effect) is transferred through the
      blow.  Martial magic users may choose to use a normal touch instead.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Magical effects that are projectile in nature (such as
      <fireball />) and normally require a strike roll must be used in
      conjunction with a missile or projectile weapon of some kind (thrown
      weapon, arrow, dart, or even a bullet).
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Magical effects that are autotargeting when performed by a spellcaster
      (such as <lightning-bolt />) are no longer autotargeting.  The
      Super Power combatant must strike with any attack of his choice, which
      may be a ranged attack or a melee attack.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      The effects of a martial magic spell are in addition to those normally
      associated with a strike in combat.  If a martial artist punches a
      target and also performs the spell <Vampiric-Drain />, then the
      target will suffer normal damage from the Punch, as well as the damage
      and effects from <Vampiric-Drain />.  Likewise, if a martial
      magician shoots a target with an arrow in conjunction with
      <Energy-Blast />, then both the arrow and <Energy-Blast /> deal
      damage.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Martial magic works similar to spellcasting, with the following notes:

          <text>
      Psionics is the ability to perform magic or supernatural acts by pure
      force of will.  No incantations, materials, or special preparation is
      required.  A character that can perform these feats is called a
      Mystic.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Whereas most magic users have trained to develop their abilities,
      Mystic characters are more often &ldquo;gifted&rdquo; with magical abilities.
      Quite often these powers manifest themselves as a result of a
      traumatic event, such as a near-fatal accident, that is experienced by
      the character.  They may also be abilities that are passed down
      through a particular family<mdash />in which case the character is simply
      born with his unique powers.  Mystic characters have an innate ability
      to perform their abilities<mdash />which are completely independent of any
      kind of structured &ldquo;method&rdquo; or &ldquo;technique&rdquo;.  While mystic
      characters might join magical societies they cannot &ldquo;learn&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;teach&rdquo; mystic techniques to others.  Psionic abilities are
      something that a mystic discovers herself.
          </text>

            <item> No verbal, somatic, or material components are required.  A
        mystic can be totally still and silent and can sill use his

        ability is exactly the same as standard spellcasting.</item>
            <item> Spells are purchased from the spell list at will.  There is no

            <item> Mystics always use the WIL attribute for magic-related rolls,

          <title>Beast Magic (summoning)</title>
      
          <text>
      Beast Magic is a unique magic school.  It is the art of summoning
      creatures to aid their master.  Any magic user (spellcasting, ritual,
      etc.) may purchase summoning spells as normal.  However, a spellcaster
      that specializes in Beast Magic (and has no other magical aptitudes)
      may purchase summoning spells as if they are one rank lower than
      normal.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      There are five basic summoning spells:
          </text>
      
          <description-list>
      <item><description>Gate</description> allows the summoner to call forth a creature that appears
        somewhere near the caster.  The location of appearance must be
        within direct line of sight of the caster, and no more than 30 feet
        away.  Once the creature appears, it is free to do whatever it wants
        based on its own free will<mdash />the caster simply transports it to a
        new location.  It will return to its original location after 3D6
        rounds.</item>
      
      <item><description>Summon</description> allows the summoner to call forth a creature near the
        caster (like Gate).  This creature is bound to follow SIMPLE
        directives given by the caster.  The creature will not act in a
        hostile manner towards the caster.  If a summoner casts another
        Summon spell while another one is currently active, he must make a
        Magical Control roll.  Failure means that the new spell fails and
        the first expires immediately.</item>
      
      <item><description>Pact</description> allows the caster to form a complex bond with a creature,
        making that creature his Familiar.  The caster must first find a
        creature to use pact with<mdash />such as summoning the creature by gate
        or summon) The caster may &ldquo;control&rdquo; the creature in a manner
        similar to summon.  This is permanent and lasts until either the
        caster or the Familiar is slain.  If the caster casts Pact a while
        he already has a Familiar, the original spell expires and the caster
        suffers 1D6+3 U.  While active, the Familar is aware of what happens
        to the caster, and vice versa.  A basic empathic link exists between
        the creature and the caster.  The caster may make a Magical Control
        check in order to &ldquo;listen in&rdquo; on any of the familiar&rsquo;s senses at
        any point in time.</item>
      
      <item><description>Control</description> is very similar to summon except that the caster has
        exacting and specific control over the creature(s) summoned.  The
        caster can literally operate the creature(s) as though by &ldquo;remote
        control&rdquo;.  While Control is active, the summoner is responsible for
        literally every action made by the summoned creature<mdash />it has no
        will of its own.</item>
      
      <item><description>Transform</description> is a powerful technique in which the caster takes the
        form of the creature summoned.  The caster literally becomes the
        creature in question, but retains his own mental state and skills in
        addition to the skills of the summoned creature.  All physical
        attributes (STR, DEX, BLD) of the summoned creature replace those of
        the character, but the character retains his own mental attributes
        (INT, WIS, WIL, CHA).  This effect lasts 4x 1D4 turns.  It cannot be
        ended at will.  The transformation requires three actions to
        complete.  When the spell expires, the caster will be very tired,
        and will suffer the effects of slow, loosing 1 action per turn for
        1D4+1 turns.</item>
          </description-list>
          
          <text>
            These summon spells are used in conjunction with whatever
        creature &ldquo;spells&rdquo; a summoner knows.  In order to learn a creature
        spell, the Summoner must have encountered such a creature.  The rank
        of example creatures is shown below.  For others, see the Beastiary

      summon multiple of the same creature simultaneously, but not a mixture

            <item> Magical Studies is the academic study of magic and how it works.
        It also gives the player the ability to identify magical items or
        effects (a simple skill test), and to determine what a particular
        magical item/effect does (GM determines difficulty of the test). It
        also conveys the ability to read and write magical script.  This
        skill does not convey the ability to use magic; this skill does not
        provide MP.</item>
            <item> Magical Control gives additional (LVL<sup>2</sup><times />WIL)<times />2 MP, and is used
        to strike with and to control the effects of some spells.  While
        this skill is not required for magic use, it is commonly used.</item>
            <item> Mysticism gives an additional (LVL<sup>3</sup><times />WIS) MP.  This is the
        governing skill for learning Mystic / Psionic spells.</item>
            <item> Faith is not technically a magic skill.  However, it is used for
        Faith magic, and provides (LVL<sup>2</sup><times />WIL<times />1.5) MP.  Faith only
        provides MP to those characters who actually know Faith magic
        spells.  If a non-faith spellcaster has this skill (For example, a
        Wizard that also happens to be religious) then it does NOT provide
        any MP.</item>
            <item> Ritual Magic is used for Ritual Magic spells.  No character can
        learn a ritual spell with a higher rank than her level of Ritual
        Magic.  This skill does not provide MP.</item>

      There exist different types or categories of magic.  The different
      types of magic are:
          </text>
      
          <description-list>
            <item><description>Air</description> Air magic is varied and effective for combat mages.  The
        lower rank spells are a mixture between utility types and damaging
        spells.  The higher level combat spells are quite powerful.  Air
        magic contains Lightning spells, which have wildly varying damage
        potential.</item>
      
            <item><description>Life</description> Life magic is capable of curing the wounded, healing the
        sick, and even inflicting horrible diseases upon your opponents.  It
        is a favorite of religious orders, either for good or evil.  Most
        combat magic in this category is limited because the spells require
        touch to cast.  Some spells are capable of dealing a great deal of
        damage, but usually over a period of time.  Sufficiently advanced
        mages who practice life magic can raise the dead or kill the living
        with a simple gesture.</item>
      
            <item><description>Spiritual</description> Magic of the Spiritual category is uncommon at best.
        With relatively few low-rank spells it is usually reserved to
        advanced practitioners of magic.  However, it has some unique spells
        that make it very effective.  Spiritual magic is particularly well
        suited for combating demons or spirits.  Higher level mages can lay
        waste to legions of their enemies with single spell.</item>
      
            <item><description>Light</description> With few exceptions, Light magic is a utility category.
        It can be used to illuminate dark passages beneath the earth or
        deceive with illusion and tricks.  Light magic has many useful
        spells, many of which are available at low or middle levels.  It is
        a very useful type of magic for the rogue or healer-type character
        who wants to be useful but doesn&rsquo;t want to fight.  A few high level
        light spells can deal excellent damage, but only at a steep MP cost.</item>
      
            <item><description>Physical</description> Physical magic is an excellent choice for
        &ldquo;dual-classed&rdquo; characters that practice magic and also fight in
        melee combat.  At lower and middle levels, physical magic allows one
        to improve the abilities of others, and to manipulate the physical
        world with magic.  He can also repair broken weapons or mend
        machines.  At higher levels the school offers very effective
        defensive spells and the highly effective gravity-based offensive
        magic, which always deals solid damage.</item>
      
            <item><description>Arcane</description> Arcane magic has no direct offensive capability; this
        would appear to be a weak form of magic that has little use for an
        adventurer.  However, the ability of arcane magic to support,
        enhance, and empower the caster or his allies is unmatched.  It is
        excellent when paired with other magic of a more offensive nature.</item>
      
            <item><description>Fire</description> Fire magic is a traditional offensive type of magic.  It&rsquo;s
        spells deal high damage and are without equal for causing
        large-scale destruction.  They are also quite mana-efficient.
        However, fire magic is the easiest of all &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; attacks
        to defend against.  Fire magic is also noisy, flashy, and very
        intimidating to one&rsquo;s opponents.  Unfortunatley, this makes it
        nearly impossible to use in a stealthy manner.</item>
      
            <item><description>Earth</description> Earth magic is a varied school that combines defensive
        and offensive spells.  While neither type of spell is the most
        powerful available, they are not to be underestimated.  Earth magic
        has a number of very useful utility spells.</item>
      
            <item><description>Water</description> At lower levels, water magic is fairly weak, though it
        does combine both offensive and defensive spells.  Middle ranks
        offer effective protection and more effective combat spells.
        Higher-level water magic is legendary in effectiveness and is very
        powerful, Though many of the offensive spells have a long casting
        time, they are nearly impossible to defend against.</item>

      Most spells automatically succeed (there is no skill check necessary,
      except for Faith Magic).  Once cast, it is possible for some spells to
      miss their target however.  For these spells, the player must make a
      skill test using MAGICAL CONTROL (or <faith />) to determine if the
      strike is successful.  See the spell listing for what spells are
      auto-targeting and which aren&rsquo;t.
        </text>
      
        <text>
      If the player is interrupted while spell casting (e.g. takes damage,
      gets knocked around, etc.), he must make a skill check (Magical
      Control).  If he fails the check, the spell fails, but the MP are not
      lost.  <note>The caster may not speak while spellcasting, but may
      move around, dodge, and perform very simple physical activities.</note>
        </text>
      
        <text>
      A spell always takes effect at the end of the casting period.  The MP
      are consumed at the exact instant that the spell takes effect.
        </text>
      
        <text>
      A casting time of zero (0) means that the caster may cast the spell
      anytime, even in response to something (e.g. getting shot
      at), or having no actions remaining at the time.  Such spells require
      no command words, components, or gesturing of any kind.
        </text>
      
        <text>
      Note that a Faith magic caster must always make a Faith roll in order
      to cast any magical spell.

          <title>Magical &ldquo;Tools&rdquo;: Books, Scrolls, and Potions</title>
      
          <text>
      There exist three different kinds of magic-related books.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Type 1 is a volume that contains detailed information on how to cast a
      particular spell (or spells).  Books of this type are always written
      in magical script.  Anyone with the Magical Studies skill can read and
      understand this kind of book.  However, only those with Spellcasting
      can make real use of the contents.  A Spellcasting character can
      easily learn new spells from a book of this type.  Books of this type
      are very valuable.  The cost of a spell book like this is equal to the
      &ldquo;Book&rdquo; price column of the magic table.  If the book contains
      multiple spells, then its value is equal to the sum of the costs for
      each spell contained.  Generally speaking, books of this type only
      contain multiple spells when they are compendia of low-level spells in
      a given school of magic.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Type 2 is a volume that describes how to perform a particular spell in
      ritual format.  Books of this type might be written in any language,
      and are generally not written in magical script.  If a Ritual magic
      using character can read a book of this type, it is something like a
      cookbook for a particular ritual spell.  The character could keep the
      book as a reference or could use it to learn the ritual described.
      Ritual spell manuals are worth approximately one-quarter the cost of a
      Type 1 book.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Type 3 is a book that describes other forms of magic.  Since Faith
      magic, Martial Magic, and Mysticism are dependant on the individual
      &ldquo;casting&rdquo; the spell and not on some external &ldquo;formula&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;recipe&rdquo;, it is essentially impossible to truly document how to
      perform a given spell with nothing more than a book.  These books are
      of interest to sages and scholars who are interested in arcane
      subjects.  However, they are little more than a curiosity to actual
      practitioners of magic.  Given enough books of this type it is
      possible for a sufficiently advanced magical practitioner to figure
      out a new spell or technique, but it is no guarantee.  Books of this
      type are worth approximatley one-tenth of the listed price, depending
      on the exact subject matter contained within the volume.  They may be
      written in any language.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      Magical potions or scrolls are single-use magic spells.  Anybody can
      use a potion or scroll<mdash />whether they know anything about magic or
      not.  Spells that affect the caster or a willing recipient are
      potions.  Drinking the potion causes the spell to take effect.  Other
      spells take the form of scrolls.  Reading the scroll aloud causes the
      spell to take effect.  Both scrolls and potions are single-use only.
      Potions can be drunk in one action.  Scrolls ALWAYS take 3 actions to
      use regardless of the spell.
          </text>
      
          <text>
      A person with Magical Studies can create Books, Scrolls, and Potions
      of any spell he/she knows.  Producing such works is a long and
      expensive process:
          </text>
      
          <description-list>
            <item><description>Books</description> Requires a number of days equal to twice the rank of the
        spell squared to create.  No MP are required, but special precious
        inks and paper are required.  These materials cost approximately
        half the value of the book.</item>
      
            <item><description>Scrolls/Potions</description> Require LVL<sup>2</sup> hours to create.  They require
        MP equal to a normal casting of the spell to be expended, and
        require precious materials valued at not less than three-quarters
        the value of the finished item.  A ritualist may prepare a potion in
        half that time.</item>

          <description-list>
            <item><description>Black</description> spells are those associated with evil, death energy, and
        demonic influence.  While they are not necissiarily evil, they are
        generally indescriminate in their targets.  Black spells never
        affect demons, undead, or targets that are not living, such as
        ghosts or robots.</item>
      
            <item><description>White</description> spells are those that are comprised of life energy.  They
        are technically not &ldquo;good&rdquo; aligned, though they are a favorite of
        &ldquo;good&rdquo; religious orders.  White spells that cause damage only
        affect demons, undead, and spirits.</item>
      
            <item><description>Auto</description> spells are those that are automatically targeting.  That
        means that once cast the spell will never miss or malfunction.
        However, in order to cast an auto-targeting spell, the caster must
        be able to clearly see and identify his target.</item>

        <text>
    The governing skill for <martial-arts /> is the Academic Skill,
    <martial-arts />, which is rank 2.  All combat skills fall under
    the <ae />gis of <martial-arts />. This means that a character engages in
    combat<mdash />whether or not they have any facility in Martial
      Arts<mdash />they must still engage as a Martial Artist. For instance,
    the Academic skill Hunting covers many areas (ambuscade, rifle
    or bow shooting, skinning, stalking etc.), however these skills are
    related to a stress-free environment. <combat />, on the other hand, is a
    high-stress environment requiring special training for weapons. Those
    skills considered useful for hunting have little use in a combat
    arena<mdash />and may even be a detriment.

          <title>Rules</title>

    <martial-arts /> covers the use of all weapons (ranged, melee,
    ultratech, mecha, et al.), in addition to hand-to-hand (HtH) combat,
    and the set of specialized skills that are associated with the
    <martial-arts /> governing skill.  The maximum level that any
    character may have in any <martial-arts /> skill is less than or equal to
    his level in <martial-arts />, i.e. if he has 3 Levels in <martial-arts />,
    then all of his <martial-arts /> skills must be Level 3 or less.  The
    basic Martial Art skill confers upon the martial artist the ability to
    purchase the different skills listed in this section.
          </text>
    
          <text>
    For each level the martial artist has in <martial-arts /> they may choose
    one <martial-arts /> skill; for this skill, any time the martial artist
    would have to roll the skill, they get an extra die to do so. A
    skill may only be chosen
    Level-in-<martial-arts />/2 times (the Lvl in
    <martial-arts />, divided by two, rounded-down).
          </text>

    Kim NG<cedilla>o</cedilla>c G<vcap>o</vcap>ay is an
      expert in Norse Boxing (Nyrkkeily), he chooses, when he gets his
      first level in <martial-arts />, he also buys a level in &ldquo;Punch/Kick;&rdquo;
      in particular, he also assigns his level-bonus to &ldquo;Punch/Kick.&rdquo;
      This means when he rolls to strike with a punch he rolls two
      dice and not one.
            </text>
          </example>
    
          <text>
    After the <martial-arts /> skill has been purchased, skills from
    the four basic categories may be acquired; the four categories
    represent different capabilities that <martial-arts /> covers. The
    five categories are <basic />, <combat />,
    <defensive />, and <modifier />. The different categories
    focus on different phases of <combat />, such that <combat />
    skills are designed to aid the Martial Artist with movement,
    entering/exiting combat, the knowledge of combat, deployment, and
    higher-level strategy. <basic /> skills are involved in the
    nitty-gritty (basic) postures and moves to actually strike
    the opponent and inflict harm or
    death. <defensive /> skills are designed to deflect,
    dodge, and/or otherwise avoid the mishap of being harmed by another
    pugilist. <modifier />s represent ways to modify
    <basic /> skills.
          </text>
    
    <description-list>
      <item><description><basic /></description> These skills represent <basic /> combat actions, such as
      punching or kicking, grappling, the use of weapons and other
      primitive attacks. <note>Only <basic /> attacks may be modified
        by a <modifier />.</note></item>
    <item><description><combat /></description> These are the skills for being in, around, or preparing
      for combat. For example, knowledge of the terrain, etiquette, being
      prepared to move quickly and with assurance.</item>
    
    <item><description><defensive /></description> These are the skills used for defending against an
      attack. They are the foil to the <basic /> skills.</item>
    
    <item><description><modifier /></description> A <modifier /> is a skill used to modify a <basic /> attack. A
      <modifier /> changes the behaviour of a <basic /> attack; the <basic /> attack
      is now considered a <special /> attack of the same name with the
      <modifier /> as the adjective, for instance, if the Martial Artist is
      modifying a Punch with a Bash, then this is now a <special />
      attack, &ldquo;Bashing Punch.&rdquo; Since a modified <basic /> attack counts as a
      <special /> attack, it may not be further modified, as only <basic />
        attacks can be modified. There are certain <combat /> skills which
      enable the Martial Artist to consider certain specific combinations
      of <modifier />/<basic /> to be <basic /> attacks.</item>
    </description-list>
    
          <note>A <modifier /> may not be used more than Lvl times per turn.</note>
    
          <example>
            <title>Candlestick modifies his punch</title>
            <text>
    Candlestick has two
      levels in <martial-arts />; he has bought Punch at rank 3
      and level 3, and chosen it as his bonus; he also has Bash at
      level 1 and Feint at level 1. He is striking at the Giant
      Hispaniola Solenodon with a Bashing Punch. Because he is
      using Bash with his Punch his punch is now considered
      &ldquo;special&rdquo; and may not be further modified, even though he could
      still use his Feint this turn.

    You will note that there is no &ldquo;chi&rdquo; or &ldquo;super-powers&rdquo; in
    <martial-arts />. In fact, the skills are deliberately kept
    pedestrian<mdash />those possessed (or assumed to be possessed, if possible)
    by the greatest &ldquo;non-mystical&rdquo; martial artists in the &lsquo;real world.&rsquo;
    This is done deliberately to provide a clear separation between the
    Supernormal<mdash />governed by Magic and Traits<mdash />and the
    mundane reality of kicking, spitting, biting and hurting. If
    you want to create a character that has truly jaw-dropping magical
    abilities, like flying-through the air, or punching through a
    fired-brick wall, bending steel, or leaping from roof-top-to-roof-top,
    consider looking into the Magic and Traits section. In
    Magic there a several categories that would benefit a Martial
    Artist tremondously.

    Also there are several para-skills which are tremondously
    important to the dedicated Martial Artist: Kata,
    Kung Fu, Waza, and Jitsu. These skills allow the
    Martial Artist to transform his very <basic /> and <defensive /> attacks,
    allowing him to perform prodigious feats: a Savage Feinting Death
    Strike is only possible by using these skills.

    is thus divided into three parts:</text>
    
    <description-list>
        <item description="Base types">: the fundamental attributes, abilities, and &ldquo;look&rdquo;
      of the base creature</item>
        <item description="Templates">: modifications to the base-type that give the
      &ldquo;flavor&rdquo; of the monster</item>
        <item description="Examples">: that have been pre-generated</item>
    </description-list>
    
            <section><!-- Base Types -->
                <title>Base Types</title>
    
    <text>The base-types are the fundamental &ldquo;type&rdquo; or &ldquo;look&rdquo; of the
    monster, they are:</text>
    
    <description-list>
        <item description="Anthropoid"> essentially symmetric, bipedal, a head (and possible
      tail) etc.; a <emph>human</emph>-like monster
        </item>
        <item description="Bipedal"> covers non-anthropoid bipedal monsters, e.g. Duck,
      Chipmunk, Wyvern (two legs, two wings)
        </item>
        <item description="Quadruped"> typical of regular animals (mammals), e.g. Dog,
      Dragon (two legs, two arms, two wings)
        </item>
        <item description="Serpent"> tubes, e.g. Snail</item>
        <item description="Polymelic"> monsters with many legs or many arms, e.g. Angelus
      Guhendrian (torus with twelve wings, and an eyeball)
        </item>
        <item description="Amorphous"> blobs, pools, puddles, whiffs-of-smoke </item>
    </description-list>
    
    <text>When constructing a monster, the base-type must be chosen. Based on
    the base-type, the size of the creature is chosen. The table below
    lists the fundamental physical attributes of the various base-types.</text>

    <text>Traits are supernatural (supernormal or paranormal) capabilities. They
    are differentiated from <magic /> because they are singular in
    nature. For instance, a trait could be a specific power that a monster
    has, a specific power of a SuperHero. It can be the result of means
    magical, chemical, mutation, or some future technology.</text>
    
    <text>The important part is that the power occurs singularly and
    uniquely and is not part of some larger &ldquo;system,&rdquo;
    i.e. <magic />. <traits /> are generally bought at only one
    level, but can be purchased at higher levels, if it is pertinent. If a
    <traits /> needs &ldquo;points&rdquo; to power it, these are taken from the
    character's Mana Points.</text>
    
    <text>Since many traits overlap magical spells, there is a specific trait
    designed for using abilities to some specific spell, this trait is
    called <spell-ability />.</text>
