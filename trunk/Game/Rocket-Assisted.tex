Rocket-assisted weapons are modern versions of traditional archaic weapons.  They have small rocket motors contained in the weapon.	When the weapon is swung,  the motor ignites, giving extra force to the blow.  They are used with the same skill as normal archaic weapons.

If such a weapon is used, and the target is \emph{missed}, then it takes an extra two actions to recover.  If the target is hit but the blow	is parried or blocked, then it takes the normal time to recover.

When using rocket assisted weapons, you need an EXTRA success to parry melee attacks.  (At least two better than attacker.)

Each weapon can store up to 5 ``rocket charges.''  When these are used up, they must be refilled before the weapon can be used.	Each charge costs \$100 to refill.
