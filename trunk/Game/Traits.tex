Traits are supernatural (supernormal or paranormal) capabilities. They
are differentiated from \emph{Magic} because they are singular in
nature. For instance, a trait could be a specific power that a monster
has, a specific power of a SuperHero. It can be the result of means
magical, chemical, mutation, or some future technology.

The important part is that the power occurs \emph{singularly} and
\emph{uniquely} and is not part of some larger ``system,''
i.e. \emph{Magic}. \emph{Traits} are generally bought at only one
level, but can be purchased at higher levels, if it is pertinent. If a
\emph{Trait} needs ``points'' to power it, these are taken from the
character's Mana Points.

Since many traits overlap magical spells, there is a specific trait
designed for using abilities to some specific spell, this trait is
called \emph{Spell Ability}.

Blargh! I'm ded!

NOTES: {\small \textbf{Need to remove all the traits which overlap
spells in Magic. Need to point people to the \emph{Spell Ability}
trait.}}
