    <title>Traits</title>
    
<text>Traits are supernatural (supernormal or paranormal) capabilities. They
are differentiated from <emph>Magic</emph> because they are singular in
nature. For instance, a trait could be a specific power that a monster
has, a specific power of a SuperHero. It can be the result of means
magical, chemical, mutation, or some future technology.</text>

<text>The important part is that the power occurs <emph>singularly</emph> and
<emph>uniquely</emph> and is not part of some larger <dquo>system,</dquo>
i.e. <emph>Magic</emph>. <emph>Traits</emph> are generally bought at only one
level, but can be purchased at higher levels, if it is pertinent. If a
<emph>Trait</emph> needs <dquo>points</dquo> to power it, these are taken from the
character's Mana Points.</text>

<text>Since many traits overlap magical spells, there is a specific trait
designed for using abilities to some specific spell, this trait is
called <emph>Spell Ability</emph>.</text>
