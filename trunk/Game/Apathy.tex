\chapter{Core Rules}
    
    

\section{Introduction}
    
    {  
    \APATHY{}  is a paper \& pencil role-playing game.
            \APATHY{}'s authors have played a great many RPGs
            including D\&D, Heroes Unlimited, GURPS, Shadowrun, TMNT,
            various White Wolf games (Vampire, etc.), Deadlands, and a
            few others. While these games are all fun, we felt that each
            game had various shortcomings that could be improved upon.
            Enter \APATHY{}. \APATHY{}  is designed to be a very
            flexible role-playing system. \APATHY{}  can handle classic
            games with knights and dragons, as well as modern-day,
            Cyberpunk, superhero, or futuristic scenarios. It excels at
            fantasy games that blend all genres.
          
    }
  
    {  
    \APATHY{}  is recommended for advanced role-players (or
            at least for experienced DM/GM/Storytellers). This is because
            the \APATHY{}  system is designed for a unique mix of speed
            and realism rather than carefully `balanced'
            rules. The \APATHY{}  rules make it very easy to make
            unbalanced (`min-maxed') or tweaked characters.
            \APATHY{}  is likewise not appropriate for `rules
            lawyers' or excessively anal GMs and players.
          
    }
  
    {  
    \APATHY{}  was created around several core features.
            These are what make \APATHY{}  a unique game system:
          
    }
  
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   
               
    {  
    \APATHY{}  has no fixed character classes, such as
                `fighter' or `wizard', etc.
                Players can pick and choose every detail of their
                character, rather than being forced into set classes.
              
    }
    
            
  \item   
               
    {  
    \APATHY{}  contains rules for all manner of
                technological and supernatural powers, weapons, items,
                and skills for characters to use. These range from
                archaic concepts like martial arts and swords, through
                ultra-modern concepts such as cybernetics and
                mechaand the supernatural abilities of magic and
                psionics. These different elements can be used
                simultaneously without any one being excessively
                powerful.
              
    }
    
            
  \item   
                
    {  
     There are no discrete `levels' for
                 character advancement. Characters develop and grow
                 constantly, rather than infrequent, sudden, increases
                 common to level-based games. There is a distinct and
                 obvious increase in `power' as characters
                 grow. This gives players the feeling that their
                 characters are constantly improving as the game
                 continues. 
    }
  
            
  \item   
               
    {  
     The game rules are purposely devoid of
                `fluff' rules. Time-consuming (and therefore
                not fun) look-up tables and thick books of rules are
                nowhere to be found. \APATHY{}  is designed to be fast
                to play. Most of the `tables' in the \APATHY{}  manuals are just to explain things to the players and
                aren't used during play.
              
    }
    
            
  \item   
               
    {  
     While \APATHY{}  is devoid of many `clutter
                rules', it does have an emphasis on realism.
                \APATHY{}'s combat system is an excellent
                compromise between speed and realism.
              
    }
    
            
\end{itemize}
  
    {  
     In any game of \APATHY{}, the CHARACTERS are the
            heroes!
          
    }
  
    

\section{Basic Terms}
    
\begin{description}
    
  \item[
                \emph{ Action }
              ] 
    {  
     An action is the most basic unit of time during
                 combat. It is roughly equal to one second of time. Most
                 characters will have three Actions per turn, though
                 certain things can increase or decrease this number.
                 Note that as long as a character is unconscious, he or
                 she always has at least one Action per turn. 
    }
  
  \item[
                \emph{ Base Armor }
              ] 
    {  
      A character's natural resistance to bodily
                 harm of unusual varieties. You can think of this as
                 `toughness' (not to be confused with the
                 skill of the same name). A character's base armor
                 reduces the damage they suffer from U (undefined)
                 damage. Base Armor does not protect against any other
                 form of damage, such as P, S, C, or D. Note, that if a
                 character suffers any U damage, no matter how high their
                 Base Armor might be, they always loose at least 1 HP.
                 
    }
  
  \item[
                \emph{ C }
              ] 
    {  
      An abbreviation for 
                 \emph{ crushing } . When used in conjunction
                  with a weapon, it indicates that the weapon in question
                  deals Crushing type damage. When used in conjunction
                  with armor, it indicates how much Crushing damage the
                  armor will defend against.
              
    }
  
  \item[ CP ] 
    {  
      Character Points. These are points you use to
                 `purchase' skills, equipment, etc. for your
                 character. CP can also be used to increase attributes
                 according to a special table. See the section on
                 character creation. 
    }
  
  \item[ Character ] 
    {  
      A persona within the game world that is adopted
                 by a player. The player sees through the
                 character's eyes, controls the character's
                 Actions, and speaks through the character's mouth.
                 
    }
  
  \item[ D ] 
    {  
      An abbreviation for Direct Damage. D damage is
                 applied directly against the target's HP. Armor,
                 including Base Armor, cannot protect against D damage.
                 Fortunately, D damage sources are few and far between.
                 
    }
  
  \item[ Game Master ] 
    {  
      A person who is in the game that is not a player.
                 The Game Master controls the game world that the players
                 inhabit. He/she controls everything that is not the
                 players. This includes other people (sometimes called
                 non-player characters), monsters, natural events, etc.
                 This is usually abbreviated as `GM'. 
    }
  
  \item[ HP ] 
    {  
      Abbreviation for Hit Points. Hit Points are used
                 to represent a character's health. If a character
                 gets injured, their HP decreases. If a character reaches
                 0 HP, they fall unconscious. If a character reaches -X
                 HP, where X is equal to their maximum HP, they are dead.
                 Note that if a character is below 0 HP, they will loose
                 1 HP per turn (1 HP per 3 seconds when not in combat)
                 due to bleeding, unless they are given medical
                 attention. 
    }
  
  \item[ HTH ] 
    {  
      see Hand-to-Hand 
    }
  
  \item[ Hand-to-Hand ] 
    {  
      Hand-to-hand is a special type of combat. It
                 takes place when the combatants use no weapons of any
                 kind. Thus, in hand-to-hand combat, only punches, kicks,
                 and similar attacks will take place. 
    }
  
  \item[ Luck Points ] 
    {  
      Usually, this is short for Luck Points. Luck
                 Points are accumulated during gameplay, and players
                 redeem them for combat bonuses, or for saving their
                 character's butt if things get rough. This is used
                 to help unLuck Pointsy die rolls from screwing over
                 players. All major character in the game, including
                 significant NPCs, villains, etc. will have Luck Points.
                 The GM is responsible for distributing Luck Points.
                 
    }
  
  \item[ MA ] 
    {  
      Abbreviation for Martial Arts. It is sometimes
                 used to refer to the Martial Arts skill. See the Martial
                 Arts section for more information. 
    }
  
  \item[ MP ] 
    {  
      Magic Points, also called Mana. Magic points
                 measure how much magic a character can use in a certain
                 amount of time. Each time magic is used (a spell is
                 cast, or the character makes a rune) MP are consumed. If
                 a character has no MP, they cannot use any magic until
                 the MP replenish. MP replenish naturally over time. See
                 the Magic section for details. 
    }
  
  \item[ Melee ] 
    {  
      Melee is a special type of combat. Melee combat
                 takes place when there are no projectile (launched,
                 thrown, shot, etc.) weapons or attacks of any kind.
                 Melee combat includes things like hand-to-hand fighting,
                 or using weapons like swords, clubs, etc. 
    }
  
  \item[ Missile ] 
    {  
      A missile weapon is one that flies through the
                 air in some manner. Throwing knives, slings, thrown
                 stones, spears, and arrows are examples of missile
                 weapons. 
    }
  
  \item[ Non-Player Character ] 
    {  
      A person controlled by the Game Master who
                 interacts with the players. A non-player character is
                 anyone in the game world not controlled by a player.
                 
    }
  
  \item[ NPC ] 
    {  
      See Non Player Character. 
    }
  
  \item[ P ] 
    {  
      An abbreviation for Piercing. When used in
                 conjunction with a weapon, it indicates that the weapon
                 in question deals piercing type damage. When used in
                 conjunction with armor, it indicates how much piercing
                 damage the armor will defend against. 
    }
  
  \item[ PC ] 
    {  
      Power Cells. This is a measurement of energy or
                 power for things like mecha, vehicles, robots, and power
                 armor. Power, measured in PC, is produced by things like
                 engines and is consumed by movement systems and weapons,
                 etc. PC can also mean `player character'.
                 
    }
  
  \item[ Player ] 
    {  
      An actual person, like the authors of this
                 manualor youwho controls a character in
                 the game world. 
    }
  
  \item[ Round ] 
    {  
      A `round' is the most general unit of
                 time during combat. Any sequence of combat is broken
                 down into one or more rounds. During each round, each
                 combatant gets to take one turn. A round is over
                 whenever all combatants have taken a turn (or are unable
                 to for some reason). 
    }
  
  \item[ S ] 
    {  
      An abbreviation for Slashing. When used in
                 conjunction with a weapon, it indicates that the weapon
                 in question deals Slashing type damage. When used in
                 conjunction with armor, it indicates how much Slashing
                 damage the armor will defend against. 
    }
  
  \item[ Size ] 
    {  
      A representation of the approximate Size of
                 objects such as people, mecha, etc. Humans are Size
                 level 2. Each Size level is approximately double the
                 height and weight of the Size below it. So, Size 2
                 covers things up to about 7' tall. Size 3,
                 therefore, is about 14' tall. 
    }
  
  \item[ Turn ] 
    {  
      A turn is a unit of time during combat. Each
                 round of combat is broken down into one turn per
                 combatant. During each player's turn, they get to
                 do whatever they want. A turn is roughly equal to three
                 seconds of time. Each turn is subdivided into Actions.
                 
    }
  
  \item[ U ] 
    {  
      An abbreviation for undefined damage. Undefined
                 damage is a special type of damage that cannot be
                 prevented by normal armor. It is usually caused by
                 supernatural powers, magic, high tech weapons, and
                 similar unusual sources. Normal (P/S/C) armor cannot
                 protect against U damage. With very few exceptions, the
                 ONLY thing that can protect a character from U damage is
                 his or her Base Armor. Note, that if a character suffers
                 any U damage, no matter how high their Base Armor might
                 be, they ALWAYS loose 1 HP. 
    }

\section{Game World}
    
    {  
    \APATHY{}, like most role-playing games, can be
            thought of like a play or a movie. The players are like the
            actors; their characters are the heroes and heroines of the
            story. Like a movie, a game can take place in any number of
            settings. The GM is like the director, and decides the
            intricacies of the game world.
          
    }
  
    {  
     The GM should talk with the players and decide upon
             what kind of game world they would like to use. The GM can
             then finalize the details of that world, and should tell the
             players about it before the players make their characters
             and the game starts. 
    }
  
    {  
     Some things to think about when creating the game
             world are the following: 
    }
  
\begin{enumerate}
      
  \item   
                
    {  
     Time Period: Medieval? Modern-day? Futuristic?
                 
    }
  
            
  \item   
                
    {  
      Location: on Earth? A different planet? A
                 particular city, perhaps? 
    }
  
            
  \item   
              
    {  
      Level of technology 
    }
    
            
  \item   
                
    {  
      Allowed game subsections: Magic? Psionics?
                 Supernatural Powers? etc. 
    }
  
            
\end{enumerate}
  
    {  
     The \APATHY{}  system contains sections for many
            different types of games and many different historical
            settings. The GM should decide which ones to allow for each
            game.
          
    }

     The first step in playing \APATHY{}  is determining
            your character concept. Talk to the GM and your fellow
            players for ideas about the game setting and what kind of
            character you might want to play. Your imagination is the
            only real limit as to what your character can be. Perhaps you
            want to play a heroic knight that fights for honor and puts
            monsters to the sword? Or maybe you'd rather play a
            cunning and seductive thief with a hidden agenda. You could
            be a young mecha pilotinexperienced, but eager to
            fight for his cause. Your character is a hero in the game.
            You should take this opportunity to have fun and do things
            you can't do in real life.
          
    }
  
    {  
     If you are having trouble thinking up a character
             concept, you might want to look to books, movies, or even
             historical precedent as to what kind of character you want
             to play. You could be a space mercenary like Han Solo from
             Star Wars, or maybe a secret agent like James Bondor
             perhaps an old-west gunslinger. 
    }
  
    {  
     Once you have an idea so to what kind of character you
             want to play, it's time to develop that idea. Think
             about what your character looks like. How old are they? How
             do they dress? What kinds of possessions do they have? What
             do they do for a living? What was their past? How would they
             react in a fight? What would they do if they were suddenly
             given a lot of money? What are their fears? Their hopes?
             Their goals? 
    }
  
    {  
     Now you should have a good understanding of your
            character's appearance, personality, skills, etc. What
            you need to do next is represent that idea in the \APATHY{} 
            system rules. Grab a character sheet, and follow along.
          
    }
  
    

\subsection{Character Basics}
    
    {  
     The first part of describing your character is very
               simple. Decide what your character's basic
               description is like. Are they male or female? How tall?
               What do they weigh? Fill in age, sex, height, weight, eyes
               color, and hair color/style on the upper right portion of
               your character sheet. Decide on your character's
               name, and fill that in too. There is also a spot on the
               character sheet for your name. Now you can move on to the
               details of your character. 
    }
  
    

\subsection{Attributes}
    
    {  
    \APATHY{}  models characters by means of a core
              attribute system. These attributes are numbers that
              describe the most basic characteristics of any given
              character. They are:

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ Throughout this document the attributes will usually
               be mentioned using the three-letter abbreviation instead
               of the full name. }


    {  
     The first three attributes (STR, DEX, and BLD) are
               considered Physical Attributes. The second three
               attributes (INT, WIS, and WIL) are Mental Attributes. The
               seventh, CHA, is a little of both, but is generally
               considered to be a Mental Attribute. 
    }
  
    {  
     Attributes are rated on a scale. 1 is the lowest
               possible attribute score. There is no top end on the
               scale, though an attribute of 20 is the peak of human
               ability. A human character can never have an attribute
               higher than 20 without some supernatural effect (super
               power, magic, cybernetics, etc). 
    }
  
    {  
     When creating a character, the GM allows you a
               certain number of attribute points. Attribute Points are
               used to purchase the attribute values you want your
               character to have. A normal human has about 40 attribute
               points. An above average human would have about
               105140 attribute points. We recommend that 120
               Attribute Points be assigned to starting
               charactersafter all, player characters are supposed
               to be heroicthough the GM has the final word.
               
    }
  
    {  
     The cost of an attribute is computed like a skill
              with Rank 1 (see the skill section later on). However, the
              final value for the attribute (for a Human) is increased by
              8; that is, if you buy 5 levels of STR (for 15 AP), then
              the final value of the STR is \begin{math} 5  +
               8  =    13 \end{math}.
            
    }
  

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ In most cases no player may have an attribute below
               8. Attributes below 8 are considered handicapped and/or
               disabled, and such a character would probably not be
               adventuring! }



\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ If the GM deems it OK, then you may reduce an
               attribute below 8, but you get NO benefits (you
               wouldn't get points in another attribute for
               example). Why would you do this? Simple, it's in
               your character concept. Would a 6-year-old child have an 8
               STR? Not likely. }


    {  
     When recording your attributes on the character
               sheet, record the number of Attribute Points you spent on
               that attribute, this will help you when you wish to
               increase them later. 
    }
  

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ No attribute can be above a 20 for a natural human.
               A 20 is considered the peak of human ability. 11 or so is
               average. Below 8 is considered handicapped for an adult
               human. Note that certain things can increase attributes
               above 20, such as supernatural powers, magic, cybernetics,
               etc. }


    {  
     Character Points (see next section) can be used to
               purchase Attribute Points for increasing your attributes
               later on. 
    }
  
    

\subsection{Sub-Attributes}
    
    {  
     There are a number of `sub-attributes'
               that rely on your attributes to determine their value. The
               names, description, and method for determining their value
               are listed below.

\subsection{Character Points}
    
    {  
     The remainder of the character creation process is
               done through the expenditure of Character Points,
               otherwise known as CP. Talk with your GM about how many CP
               you should use to create your character with. We have
               found that for a group of 3-4 players 125 CP is about
               right. Typically the more players, the fewer CP characters
               should have. This will keep the group from becoming too
               powerfulunless this is the GM's intent.

              systems. The \APATHY{}  system allows the player to decide
              every detail pertaining to his character, rather than being
              stuck with a `default' set of abilities and
              skills. It is up to the player to use his CP to develop a
              well-rounded character. Note that there are NO skills that
              come `free.' If your character is literate,
              then that skill needs to be purchased. Know how to drive a
              car? Buy the skill.

\subsection{Increasing Attributes (optional)}
    
    {  
     If your attributes aren't quite where you
               desire, you will need to get more Attribute Points so you
               can purchase a better attribute. Each Attribute Point
               costs 1 Character Point. Once you purchase the number of
               Attribute Points you want, just look at the table found in
               the Attributes section above to see how many total
               Attribute Points you must spend to get that attribute.
               
    }
  
    {  
     You must pay a number of Attribute Points equal to
              the difference between what you want, and what you already
              have. For example: if you currently have an 11 STR (6
              Attribute Points) and wish to increase it to a 14 (21
              Attribute Points) that will cost you 15 Attribute Points (
              \begin{math} 9  -  4  =
               5 \end{math} ). Since Attribute Points cost
              1 Character Point each, going from an 11 in an attribute to
              a 14 will cost 15 CP.
            
    }
  
    {  
     Remember to keep track of how many Attribute Points
               you have spent on your attributes so you can easily
               increase them at a later date. 
    }
  
    {  
     Note that attribute increases are major additions to
               your character, and they should be role-played as such.
               Significant attribute changes represent months if not
               years of hard work! Here are some examples of possible
               means of increasing attributes:

\section{Skills}
    
    {  
     All characters have skills. Skills represent what your
             character has learned and what they know how to do. Other
             than being useful in game, skills help to distinguish your
             character from everyone else in the world. Are you going to
             play a diplomat? You better have diplomacy, law, and similar
             skills. A warrior? Better have that shield and/or weapon
             skills handy! 
    }
  
    {  
     Skills have a number of pieces of information
             associated with them. They have a Rank, Associated
             Attribute, Description, and Level. 
    }
  
    {  
     The rank determines how hard a skill is to learn.
             Higher the rank, the more time and CP it will take to get
             better at it. Rank 1 skills are the simplest and easiest to
             learn. Skills that are more difficult have higher ranks.
             Rank can also be thought of as the `cost' or
             `price' of a skill. 
    }
  
    {  
     An associated attribute tells you what attribute is
             used in the skill roll. This is the attribute that is used
             along with any particular skill. This is discussed in more
             detail below.

     Level is how good your particular character is at the
             skill. You will use CP to purchase levels in a skill, which
             is discussed below. If you don't know a skill at all,
             you have Level 0 in that skillmeaning you don't
             know anything about it. The more you know about the skill,
             the higher your level. This is often abbreviated as
             `Lvl' (alt. `LVL'). You must
             purchase your skill levels with CP. Below is a simple chart
             indicating what different levels correspond to:

     If not, here's yet another way to look at
             purchasing skills. 
    }
  
    {  
     To get level 1 of a skill, you must spend the Rank in
             CP. To get to the next level, add the rank of the skill to
             the amount of CP you spent the last time you increase the
             skill (and just that last increase, not the total amount
             you've spent on the skill) and that is the amount that
             you need to spend. 
    }
  
  

\quotexample[Computing Skill Cost]{
    {  
     I want to purchase the shield skill (rank 2). To get
               Lvl 1 I would need to spend 2 CP. Now, if I want to go
               from Lvl 1, to Lvl 2, I would add the rank (2) to the
               amount I spent on the last level increase (2 CP), to get
               the new cost, in this case I would need to spend a total
               of 4 CP (rank of 2 + 2 CP from last purchase). So now the
               total amount I have spent on this skill is 6 CP. Lets say
               I'm not happy with my Lvl 2 shield skill, and wish
               to upgrade it to level 3. I would again take the rank (2)
               and add it to the amount I spent on the last increase (4)
               to get the number of CP I must spend to upgrade the skill.
               In this case, I must spend an additional 6 CP. Therefore,
               to get a level 3 shield skill (or any skill or rank 2), I
               must spend a total of 12 CP. 
    }
  }
  

  
    {  
     If you take a look at the little chart above, you will
             see that at the desired skill level (3) the CP cost is a 6,
             which I then multiply by the rank (2) to get 12 CP, the same
             thing I got when I did it out by hand. 
    }
  
    {  
     Note that the chart will only tell you how many total
             Character Points. To get the number of CP needed to increase
             to the next level, just subtract the upper number from the
             lower one. A more complete version of the above table can be
             found at the end of this manual. 
    }
  
    {  
     Once you are in game and earning experience, you can
             increase the level of a skill you currently have at least
             one level in by paying the appropriate CP cost. If you wish
             to learn the first level of a skill you don't have
             yet, it takes a number of weeks of intense studying equal to
             the rank of the skill.

\subsection{Skill Specialization (optional)}
    
    

\subsubsection{Specialization in most Skills}
    
    {  
     It is possible to specialize in many skills. When
                 specialized, a character knows more about a certain
                 aspect of the skill than other parts of the skill. In
                 game terms, you are +1 LVL when performing a check in
                 the area of your specialization, but are -4 to your roll
                 when you are performing a check outside of your
                 specialization. Specializing does NOT cost any extra CP.
                 
    }
  
  

\quotexample[History$\rightarrow$Spanish]{
    {  
     Ralf Gr--sse-Kunstleve is a historian.
                   Specifically, he is knowledgeable about Spanish
                   history. He has a LVL 3 History skill with a
                   specialization in Spanish History. This means that if
                   Juan had to make a skill check related to Spanish
                   history, he would roll 4 dice. (3 from his LVL, +1
                   from the specialty.) However, if he had to make a
                   History roll about another kind of history, he would
                   only roll 3 dice, and be at a -4 to his roll. 
    }
  }
  

  
    {  
     Note that you can choose to buy a particular skill
                 more than once with different specialties, if you feel
                 like it. When this happens the roll for `outside
                 of specialty' skill checks is the highest of the
                 skill levels -4 +1 for each skill beyond the first.

    {  
     It is possible to specialize in most skills. Talk
                 to your GM about specializing to see which skills you
                 think are appropriate and which ones are not. 
    }
  
    {  
     Specializing in skills is purely optional. 
    }
  
    

\subsubsection{Specialization applied to Weapon skills}
    
    {  
     It is also possible to specialize in weapon
                 skills. If a character has a specialized weapon skill
                 that means that he is especially proficient with a very
                 specific type of weapon. When wielding a weapon that
                 matches a character's specialty, that character
                 receives +1 LVL to the skill. This bonus applies to
                 attack (strike) rolls, and defensive rolls (parry), if
                 applicable. When using a weapon that is outside the
                 character's specialty, the character is at -1 LVL.
                 Note that Weapon skill specialization does NOT affect
                 damage rolls. 
    }
  
    {  
     Specializing in a weapons skill costs 3 CP in
                 addition to the normal cost of the skill. Specializing
                 can be applied to all weapon proficiency type skills and
                 the shield skill. 
    }
  
  

\quotexample[Axes$\rightarrow$Nordic War Axe]{
    {  
     Bj---rgen is a warrior with a liking for
                   the Nordic War Axe. He has the skill `Archaic
                   Weapons: Axes' at level 3. As well, he is
                   specialized in the Nordic War Axe. The total skill
                   cost is 9 CP. That is 6 CP for Level 3 in a Rank 1
                   skill, Plus 3 CP from the specialization. When welding
                   a Genuine Nordic War Axe$^{TM}$ in combat, Gunnar has
                   4 dice. However, when using any other kind of axe
                   Gunnar only has 2 dice. 
    }
  }
  

  
    {  
     Note that some unusual or esoteric weapons require
                 specialization. This is because those weapons are
                 different enough from common weapons that they require
                 special knowledge and experience in order to use them
                 properly. 
    }
  
    {  
     Most characters that specialize in weapons are
                 very particular about their weapons. For the character
                 it is almost an obsessive-compulsive issue to wield a
                 particular weapon. Generally the weapon must be very
                 specific in order to satisfy the specialty. In medieval
                 campaigns, a weapon specialty might require a sword
                 forged by a particular smith, or arrows made from a
                 certain type of wood. In a modern campaign, a weapon
                 specialty might entail a particular make and model of
                 rifle.

     Specializing in skills is purely optional.

\section{Rules (Rolls)}
    
    {  
     What would an RPG be without rules? \APATHY{}  has a
            set of rules that allow for just about any occurrence that an
            imaginative GM can put the players through.

    {  
     Lets start with the basics (some of this will be
             review): 
    }
  
    {  
     In \APATHY{}, there are three different types of die
            rolls. Every time you roll a die when playing \APATHY{},
            you will use one of these sets of rules.
          
    }
  
    

\subsection{Attribute Checks}
    
    {  
     Attribute checks are required anytime the GM wants
               to see if you did something solely based on an attribute.
               They are used whenever a player wants their character to
               do something tricky. Attribute checks are purely based on
               a character's core attributes. They are completely
               separate from skills. If a player needs to do something
               based on a particular skill, then see the skill roll
               section below. 
    }
  
  

\quotexample[Catch a Pack]{
    {  
     Barnacleez is trying to catch a pack that was
                 thrown at him. The GM requires him to make a DEX check

\quotexample[Swim a Long Distance]{
    {  
     Thomas is trying to swim a long distance while

                 applicable skills, the GM determines that she needs to
                 make an INT check in order to figure out what they mean.
                 
    }
  
    {  
     Attribute checks are always rolled the same. Roll
                 ONE twenty-sided die, add the attribute to the die, and
                 add any bonuses or negatives. If the total (die roll +
                 attribute + bonuses + negatives) is 25 or higher, then
                 the check succeeded. If you roll a 1, you fail
                 automatically, no matter what your bonuses or attributes
                 are. If you roll a 20, you succeed automatically, no
                 matter what the negatives might be. For an attribute
                 check, you always roll just one 20-sided die. 
    }
  }
  

  
    

\subsection{Contest of Attributes}
    
    {  
     Contests of Attributes occur whenever two characters
               are competing at something that is largely dependent on an
               attribute and nothing else. Arm wrestling is a contest of
               strength. Racing to complete a puzzle is a contest of
               intelligence. A trivia game would be a contest of wisdom,
               etc. 
    }
  
    {  
     A contest of attributes occurs only when there are
               multiple competitors (generally two) and only when there
               is no particular skill involved. For example, arm
               wrestling is a contest of strength but a game of 1-on-1
               basketball is generally not, because basketball is a
               complex game. 
    }
  
    {  
     When a contest of attributes occurs, all competitors
               roll \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\ensuremath{}and add the result to their attribute. The
               highest score wins, and like scores tie. The GM may wish
               to impose negatives and/or bonuses depending on the exact
               circumstances of the contest. 
    }
  
  

\quotexample[Douglas vs. Enemy Soldier]{
    {  
     Douglas (STR 13) is fighting with an enemy solider
                 (STR 12) over the possession of a single rifle. The GM
                 declares that a contest of strength will resolve who
                 manages to gain possession of the rifle. The GM rolls
                 for the solider (a three) and Douglas rolls a 1. The
                 enemy soldier has a total of 15, and Douglas has 14.
                 Therefore, the enemy soldier wrestles the rifle out of
                 Douglas's hands.

\subsection{Skill Rolls}
    
    {  
     Skill rollsare used whenever a player wants to use
               one of his character's skills. They are also used
               whenever two characters are competing at something
               (Contest of skills) related to a skill. Skill rolls are
               also used `to strike' or `to
               defend' in combat. 
    }
  
    {  
     To determine if you are successful in performing a
               skill, roll a number of D20s equal to the Level you have
               purchased the skill in. To each die, add your current
               attribute referenced by the associated attribute value of
               the skill. Each time a die with this value added to it
               reaches 25 or above, this is called a success. If you have
               at least one success, you successfully performed the
               skill. Rolling a `20' on a die will give you
               +1 successes to however many you rolled normally. Note
               that this makes it possible to have more successes than
               you have levels in a given skill. Likewise, a roll of
               `1' is -1 successes to your total. If you have
               negative successes (caused by rolling more 1s than
               successes) then you have a critical failure! In the case
               of a critical failure the GM will determine what
               (negative) outcome happens!

               the GM gives you. If the total on each die is 25 or
               greater that is a success. If the die rolls a 20,
               regardless of bonuses, attributes, etc. you get +1
               successes. If a die rolls a 1, regardless of bonuses, etc.

                 Level 2 Investigation skill. Amy has a 13 WIS, the
                 associated attribute for Investigation. The GM tells her

\subsection{Contest of Skills}
    
    {  
     A contest of skills occurs when two people are
               trying to defeat each other in some manner with their
               skills. If two characters were competing to see who could
               sing better, the character with the largest number of
               successes of the singing skill would win. The most common
               example of this is combat. In order to be successful in a
               combat situationsuch as attempting to hit an
               opponent with a sword while he is blocking with a shield,
               the initiator (or attacker) of the Action must make more
               successes than the defender.

\quotexample[Tom and the Shopkeeper in a Contest]{
    {  
     Tom is attempting to purchase an expensive suit of
                 armor, and doesn't want to pay full price. So he
                 is attempting to bring the price down by using the
                 Bargaining skill. The shopkeeper also has the Bargaining
                 skill, so a contest of skills ensues. Tom has a skill
                 level of 3, and a WIS of 13 (the associated attribute
                 for Bargaining); the shopkeeper has a level 4 Bargaining
                 (he's been at it longer than Tom has), and a WIS
                 of 10. 
    }
  
    {  
      Tom rolls 3 dice and gets a `14',
                 `20', and a `3'. Tom now adds
                 his wisdom (13) to each of these. The GM didn't
                 give any negatives or bonuses, so that is all that gets
                 added. After adding, the totals are 27, 33, and 16. Two
                 of these are 25 or higher, so Tom has two successes so
                 far. Note that Tom rolled one 20which gives him
                 an additional success. Tom has a total of three
                 successes. 
    }
  
    {  
      The shopkeeper rolls four dice (remember, he has
                 a level 4 Bargaining), and gets a `1',
                 `12', `15'', and an
                 `18'. After adding the shopkeeper's
                 WIS of 10, we get the following rolls: `11',
                 `22', `25', and
                 `28'. The 25 and 28 are both successes, but
                 the `1' is a -1 success, so the shopkeeper
                 has 1 total success. 
    }
  
    {  
      Tom has 3 successes, and the shopkeeper has 1.
                 Since Tom initiated the bargaining, and has more
                 successes than the `defender', he is
                 successful in his attempt to reduce the price of the
                 armor. How much is determined by the GM, but it should
                 be commensurate with the number of successes that Tom
                 beat the shopkeeper by. 
    }
  }
  

  
    {  
     The winner of a contest of skills is whomever rolled
               the highest number of successes. The margin of success is
               based on the difference between the two rolls. For
               example, if the `winner' had only 1 more
               success than the `loser', then the contest was
               close. However, if the `winner' had three more
               successes than the loser, then it was a decisive victory!
               
    }
  
    {  
     Ties are left up to the GM to resolve. The suggested
               protocol is as follows: 
    }
  
    {  
     If the tie occurred on a contest that entails a
               single past event or is something that is
               `judged' by outsiders, then the winner is the
               character with the higher associated attribute. (Example:
               who can paint a better picture, etc.) 
    }
  
    {  
     If the contest entails an ongoing event (such as the
               haggling over a suit of armor detailed above) then it is
               assumed that the competitors `keep at it' and
               a second roll is in order.

\subsection{Skill Rolls and Related Skills}

     If a character needs to make a skill roll and that
               character knows other skills that are somehow related to
               (or are similar to) the skill to be rolled, that character
               is generally entitled to a bonus to his or her roll. The
               exact terms of the bonus, including what skills qualify as
               `related', is determined by the GM on a
               case-by-case basis. The general rule is that each level of
               a related skill conveys a +1 to the roll. The maximum
               possible bonus from related skills is +5, regardless of
               the circumstances.

                 skills Electrical Engineering: 2, Electrician: 3,
                 Mechanic: General: 3, and Communications/Telco: 3. The
                 GM determines that since this device is purely
                 electronic, Paul's Mechanic skill is of no use. As
                 well, the GM decides that since this device is unrelated
                 to communications, Paul's Communications skill
                 does not apply either. However, the GM decides that
                 Paul's Electrical Engineering and Electrician
                 skills are relevant. The GM assigns Paul a bonus of +5
                 to his roll from his levels in those related skills.

\subsection{All Other Rolls}
    
    {  
     This type of die rolling is used for just about
               everything else in the game: rolling damage from combat,
               the duration of magical spells, or the number of monsters
               appearing in a group. 
    }
  
    {  
     Rolling dice is represented in the
                \texttt{\ensuremath{\pm}}\ensuremath{R}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{X}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{Y}\texttt{\ensuremath{\pm}}\ensuremath{Z}\textscbf{K}\footnote{ that is,
                \ensuremath{X}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{Y}\texttt{\ensuremath{\pm}}\ensuremath{Z}\textscbf{K}[\ensuremath{\texttt{\ensuremath{\pm}}\ensuremath{R}}]} format; for
               example \ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}. This means that you roll three individual
               4-sided dice, and add 1 to each die. 
    }
  
    {  
     If any die roll with its bonus added in equals or
               betters the maximum value on a die, then you get a
               rollover. When a rollover happens, re-roll that die,
               without any bonus, and add its value to the total. If the
               roll again has the highest value on the die, then another
               rollover happens. This keeps going until the highest value
               on the die is not rolled. Remember, after the first roll,
               the bonus is not applied; it's just the raw die
               roll. 
    }
  
    {  
     This may sound confusing, so we'll work with
               the example from above. Let's say you have to roll
               \ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}. You get some four-sided dice and roll three of
               them. Suppose the results are: 1, 3, and a 4. After adding
               the +1 (from the die bonus), we now have: 2, 4, and 5. We
               add all the totals up and get 11. Now we have to deal with
               the rollovers. Because the highest value on a four-sided
               dice is a 4, we have two rollovers: the 4 and 5. So we
               roll each of these again, without the original bonus, and
               get a 2 and 4. We add these to the total yielding 17. But
               wait, we have yet another rollover (the 4). So we roll
               that die again, and get a 3. We now have a total of a 20
               for our \ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}die roll. 
    }
  
    {  
     The same rules apply for any die. Lets say you are
               rolling six-sided dice. If any die (after bonuses) has a 6
               or higher, then you get a rollover. On an eight-sided die?
               You guessed it; a roll of 8 or higher will yield a
               rollover. 
    }
  
    {  
     If you have bonuses or negatives to a roll, add them
               up first, then perform the final roll. 
    }
  
    {  
     Note that if there is a minus to the die roll once
               all the bonuses/penalties are added up, then no rollover
               is possible. An example is \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{-}\ensuremath{1}. Even if you roll a 4 on
               the die it will be reduced to a 3, which does not yield a
               rollover. No die (even after negatives) can give a value
               less than 1. So, if you have a \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\texttt{-}\ensuremath{4}, and roll a 2 (which
               would theoretically total -2), then the actual total would
               be 1. 
    }
  
    {  
     Along with what is given above, die rolls might have
               a raw bonus. This is represented by a bonus in brackets
               such as this: \ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}\textscbf{}[\ensuremath{\texttt{+}\ensuremath{4}}](alt. \ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}). Raw Bonuses are
               added to the resultant total of a die roll, NOT to each
               die; thus they do not affect rollovers at all. This bonus
               is added in after all the rollovers are done with.
               Consider the prior example of \ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}but with the [+4]
               added. That would be written \ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}\textscbf{}[\ensuremath{\texttt{+}\ensuremath{4}}]. The total using
               the above numbers would be 24. 
    }
  
    {  
     Unless otherwise stated, all non-skill die rolls use
               this system. 
    }
  
    

\section{Combat Sequence \& Initiative}
    
    {  
     Combat is based on a system of Rounds, Turns, and
             Actions. A `round' lasts about five seconds. It
             is the length of time in which all combatants have done
             something. Each round is broken down into Actions. An Action
             lasts about 1 second. Each combatant gets one or more
             Actions during each round. When all combatants have used up
             their Actions, the current round is over and a new one
             starts. 
    }
  
    {  
     During your turn, you determine what you wish to do
             with your available Actions. Almost everything that you do
             of significance during your turn consumes an Action Simple
             examples of what can be done in an Action are shooting a
             gun, swing a sword, moving, or using a mystical ability.
             Keep in mind that a lot of `boring' combat stuff
             also takes up Actions: reloading your weapon, moving around,
             ducking behind cover, or taking an item out of your pack.
             Some things that you will want to do will consume multiple
             Actions per turn. 
    }
  
    {  
     All characters, by default, have three Actions per
             round. Certain skills or in-game effects might change this.
             When combat is going to start, all players need to figure
             out how many Actions they get. (typically, this will be 3
             each). 
    }
  
    {  
     At the beginning of combat, all characters must roll
             initiative. This determines who attacks first in the turn.
             When combat starts, participants must roll a \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{20}\ensuremath{}for their
             initiative. If any characters have more than 3 Actions per
             turn (due to a skill or magical effect or somesuch), then
             those characters must roll initiative twice. 
    }
  
    {  
     Various bonuses or penalties apply to initiative
             rolls. Certain skills and magical effects can alter
             initiative. As well, the GM may apply initiative bonuses or
             penalties depending on game situations, such as surprise
             attacks or ambushes. 
    }
  

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ Most characters will have 3 Actions per turn. All
             three Actions are taken at the same time, on that
             character's initiative. }


  

\quotexample[Tom's Turn in Combat]{
    {  
     Tom is in combat. Tom has three Actions and he
               rolled an 11 as his initiative. When it's
               Tom's turn in combat (11), he takes all three
               Actions at that time. 
    }
  }
  

  
    {  
     The character that has the highest initiative goes
             first, and then the character with the next highest
             initiative takes their turn, and so forth down the line
             until all combatants have taken a turn. 
    }
  
    {  
     Once all turns are over, the current round of combat
             is over. It then restarts with everyone's initiative
             being the same as it was in the previous round. This
             progression continues until combat is over. If the
             combatants change significantly during combatfor
             example, if new characters show up on the scenethe GM
             might want to make everyone re-roll their initiative. If
             something happens during combat that changes how many
             Actions the combatants have, the GM should ask that
             initiative be re-rolled. 
    }
  
    {  
     Some things that you might want to do will take up
             multiple Actions. A common example of this is spell casting,
             where many spells take several Actions to cast. If you do
             this, you may need to drag this type of Action across
             multiple Actions or even multiple turns. For example,
             let's say that you want to cast a spell that takes 3
             Actions. You can use your first Action to start casting, and
             then use your second and third Actions to finish casting the
             spell. At any time you may cancel (stop casting) the spell
             or ability with no penalty. When an ability or activity
             requires multiple Actions, it always takes place on the
             final Action that completes that activity. Also, it is
             possible to be disturbed or disrupted if you are attacked
             while performing a multiple-action activity. The GM should
             take note of this and might impose skill checks or other
             chances of failure if you get knocked around too much.
             
    }
  

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ Note that everything you may wish to do in combat
             requires one or more Actions. This includes moving around,
             drawing a weapon, using items, etc. Undoubtedly, many of
             your Actions will be used for things other than attacking.
             }


    {  
     When in combat, some characters may want to delay
             their Action until later. A character can always choose to
             `act later' in combat. When doing so the player
             states what new initiative number he wishes to act on. The
             new initiative must be lower than his current initiative
             number. Once a character's initiative is delayed it
             remains delayed (though it could be delayed even further).
             That characters initiative remains at the new, lower, number
             for the remainder of combat, unless the GM asks all players
             to re-roll initiative. Actions cannot be split between
             different initiative numbers. So, a character must either
             take all his Actions at his normal initiative, or he must
             delay all his Actions to a later initiative.

               roll, so he goes first. Tom isn't exactly sure what
               to do, so he delays his initiative until `10'.
               The GM then resumes combat as normal, with the next
               highest initiative going first. Tom has initiative 10 for
               the remainder of combat.

     Some game effects last a certain number of turns, or
             have a certain effect each turn. These effects are counted
             and take place on the affected character's turn. They
             only are counted and occur if the character begins that turn
             with the effect in place. These effects occur at the
             beginning of that character's turn in a given round.
             These effects are automatic and do not consume any time from
             the character. Resolve all effects before that character
             takes any Actions.

               not gain any HP yet, nor does this turn count against
               the duration of the spell. Now all other combatants
               take their turns. When it is again Lucy's turn

    {  
     It is possible to `hold an Action ' for
             later. Holding an Action means that the character is
             maintaining his current initiative number, but is saving an
             Action for a specific situation. A character may only hold
             one Action at a time. Furthermore, you must declare what
             your held Action will be, and under what circumstances. Held
             Actions are resolved as soon as their conditions are met.
             Held Actions `expire' if their declared
             conditions never occur at the beginning of your next turn.

\subsection{Weapons \& Equipment}
    
    {  
     Most characters will carry equipment in combat. This
               usually includes weapons and armor. There are no
               `class' restrictions for weapons or armor. Any
               character can wear any armor and wield any weapon,
               provided that the character has the appropriate attributes
               and skills. 
    }
  
    {  
     Weapons have a minimum strength requirement (MSR).
               The MSR indicates what strength is required of the
               character to properly wield a given weapon. If the
               character's strength is less than the MSR, then the
               character has -1 to strike and [-1] damage for each point
               of strength difference. 
    }
  
    {  
     The raw damage bonus (RDB) is calculated by
               subtracting 8 from the wielder's Str. The RDB is
               added as raw damage to total of the weapon's damage.
               However, all weapons have a maximum strength bonus (MSB);
               if the RDB is greater than the MSB, then the MSB is used
               as the RDB instead. 
    }
  
  

\quotexample[MSR for Bosk]{
    {  
     Bosk has a STR of 17 and is brandishing a Hercules
                Club (\ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\ensuremath{}\textscbf{C}, MSR: 12, MSB: 13). Because Bosk's Str
                is higher than the minimum strength requirement of the
                Hercules Club (12), he is entitled to a damage bonus.
                Subtract 8 from Bosk's Str score to calculate his
                bonus: \begin{math} 17    -  8
                 =  9 \end{math} . So this means
                that Bosk deals \ensuremath{9}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\ensuremath{}\textscbf{C} damage.
              
    }
  }
  

  
  

\quotexample[Bosk with Knife]{
    {  
     Suppose Bosk pulls out a long knife (\ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}\textscbf{S}, MSR:
                 8; MSB: 4). Bosk's Str is significantly higher
                 than the minimum required for the weapon. Calculating
                 his theoretical bonus, we can write: 17 - 8 = 9. At
                 first glance, it appears that Bosk is entitled to a [+9]
                 bonus. However, the maximum strength bonus for the long
                 knife is 4. Therefore, Bosk's damage roll would be
                 \ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}. 
    }
  }
  

  
    {  
     Bows never grant a damage bonus to characters with
               higher than required STR. However, it is possible to
               purchase stiffer (stronger) bows that can take advantage
               of a character's higher STR score. High-draw bows
               cost 20\% more for every 1 STR point added to the MSR. For
               each point, add [+1] damage. This can be stacked. So, a +1
               bow costs 20\% extra, a +2 bow costs 40\% extra, etc. Note
               that the maximum STR requirement that can be added to a
               bow of a given type is equal to half of its original MSR.
               Note that the damage and strike penalty for having a
               lower-than-required STR does apply to bows. Modern
               compound bows are adjustable and can be set to a higher
               than normal strength value without incurring additional
               cost. 
    }
  
    {  
     Characters will have two hands that they may use to
               wield weapons. All weapons are either one-hand or
               two-handed. Two-handed weapons, of course, require both
               hands to properly wield. One-handed weapons require only
               one hand. Therefore a player could wield one single-hand
               weapon, one two-handed weapon, two single-hand weapons, or
               one single-hand weapon and a shield or other item.
               However, when wielding two weapons the character can have
               penalties. Also, wielding two weapons does not grant the
               ability to the character to strike with both weapons in
               one Action In general, wielding two weapons gives the user
               -3 and -6 to strike with the primary and off -hand
               (respectively), and requires an additional Action These
               penalties can be mitigated with skills from Martial Arts.
               
    }
  
    {  
     Characters that use magic, aside from Martial Magic,
               must have at least one hand free when casting spells.
               Characters that use Faith magic must have a holy symbol in
               their grasp when casting magic; this requires a free hand
               to hold. Spellcasters are free to use two-handed weapons
               so long as they aren't wielding the weapon at the
               same time as they are casting spells. (Spellcasters can
               put away a weapon, cast magic freely, and then draw their
               weapon again, though this takes time) 
    }
  
    {  
     All firearms are assumed to be 2-handed by default.
               However, pistols and submachine guns may be fired with one
               hand. (See rules for using 2-handed weapons with one hand
               below). Larger firearms including rifles, shotguns, and
               heavy weapons (rocket launchers, etc.) must always be used
               2-handed. It always requires two hands to reload a
               firearm, no matter what kind it is. 
    }
  
    {  
     Bows are always two-handed weapons. Hand (small)
               crossbows can be aimed and fired with one hand. However,
               cocking and re-loading a crossbow always requires two
               hands. Larger crossbows always require two hands to fire
               as well as load. Siege weapons, cannons, heavy weapons,
               etc, always require both hands to be free in order to
               load, aim, and fire. 
    }
  
    {  
     It is possible to use two hands to fight with a
               one-handed weapon. In this case, the wielder has -1 to
               strike and effectively adds +3 to his strength. 
    }
  
    {  
     It is possible to use some two-handed weapons with
               one hand. To do so, add 4 to the minimum strength
               requirement of the weapon. Note that many two-handed
               weapons always require two hands, period. These are large
               firearms (rifles, shotguns), staves, pole arms, chains,
               and bows.

\subsection{Dual-wielding Weapons or Weapon \& Shield}
    
    {  
     As noted above, it is possible for characters to
               wield two weapons in combat, or a weapon and a shield. A
               character cannot attack with both weapons during the same
               Action unless he takes the Multi-weapon style skill in
               Martial Arts. A character using a weapon and a shield may
               not attack with his weapon and shield bash in the same
               Action for the same reason. When attacking with both
               weapons the character makes two separate attack rolls, one
               for each weapon; each attack is resolved separately. This
               takes two separate Actions. 
    }

  \item[ Two normal weapons ] 
    {  
      When wielding two weapons the weapon in the
                  character's `good' hand receives a -3
                  to strike and the weapon in the character's
                  `off' hand receives a -6. Some characters
                  can have `even-more-offhand' weapons, such
                  as a kick (or two), or literally having extra limbs. To
                  calculate the negative to strike for wielding multiple
                  weapons, first find the number of weapons being used,
                  then order them (the strike order). The first weapon is
                  at -3 to strike, the second at -6, the third ad -9, and
                  so on, i.e. the k

               is the use of the Multitarget skill which allows the
               martial artist to strike multiple times with a single
               weapon in a single Action

\subsection{Combat Overview}
    
    {  
     Resolving an attack is a three-step process: 
    }
  
\begin{enumerate}
      
  \item   
                  
    {  
     The attacker makes a strike roll. A strike roll
                   is an attempt to hit an opponent using a weapon or
                   ability. 
    }
  
              
  \item   
                  
    {  
     The defender may attempt a defensive maneuver. A
                   defensive maneuver is a special skill that is used to
                   avoid or reduce the damage from an incoming attack.
                   
    }
  
              
  \item   
                  
    {  
     If the attack was successful, damage is rolled,
                   calculated, and applied to the target. 
    }
  
              
\end{enumerate}
  
    {  
     This process is explained in detail below. 
    }
  
    

\subsection{Attacking}
    
    {  
     An attack is nearly anything that you try to do to
               an opponent during your turn. Typically an attack is a
               physical strike against your opponent with a weapon (such
               as your fist or a sword), but it could also be the use of
               a supernatural ability, magic spell, or a modern device
               such as a gun. 
    }
  
    {  
     When you attack, you use one of your skills in an
              attempt to damage your opponent. Normally, this will be a
              `basic attack' skill from Martial Arts. Any
              time you make an attack like this, you roll a Strike Roll.
              Strike roll is just a special name for a skill roll in
              combatthey work just like normal skill rolls. To
              recap, roll a number of D20s equal to your level of the
              skill you are using to attack with (i.e. use the Large
              Sword skill to strike with your bastard sword), add your
              attribute and any bonuses or negatives. For each die that
              hits 25 or better, you have a success.
               

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ If you have at least one success, you strike the
                target. }

  Otherwise you miss your target.
            
    }
  
    {  
     Some attacks don't require a skill roll. This
               includes special attacks that automatically hit your
               opponent (such as certain abilities from Martial Arts) as
               well as magical spells or supernatural powers that are
               auto-targeting. For example, the magic spell Ray of Heat
               automatically hits your opponent, with no strike roll
               needed. 
    }
  
    

\subsection{Defending}
    
    {  
     The target of an attack usually receives an attempt
              to defend himself.
               

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ Defending is using your skills to avoid getting hit
                by an incoming attack. }

  There are many different
                skills that are available for defense. They are called
                defensive maneuvers. A defensive maneuver is a special
                skill or ability that you use specifically in response to
                being attacked; otherwise they work like normal skills. A
                target of an attack may attempt to use any one defensive
                maneuver in order to protect himself from the attack. The
                most common are parrying, blocking, and the Dodge skill.
                These are described below. Other defensive maneuvers may
                be found in the Martial Arts section.
            
    }
  
\begin{description}
    
  \item[ Parry ] 
    {  
      Parrying is using your weapon to deflect a blow
                  from another weapon. Parrying may only be performed
                  with melee weapons, against either a melee or hand to
                  hand attack. Parrying is ineffective versus other
                  attacks, such as explosives, bullets, chemical
                  splashes, magical energy, etc. Parry is not a skill
                  itself, rather the skill roll for parrying is based on
                  the weapon skill you are trying to parry with. For
                  example, you would use your Knife skill to parry using
                  your dagger. You must have your weapon drawn and ready
                  in order to use it to parry. Note, that this is the
                  same skill that is used for attacking with your weapon,
                  so most characters will have a good chance at parrying.
                  

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ A weapon or similar combat skill is used for
                   parrying. Also note that parrying is always subject to
                   GM approval. The GM determines the outcome of a
                   successful parry, though it usually means that the
                   defender avoids all damage. However, if you are
                   parrying an attack from a heavy or large weapon with a
                   small weapon, the GM might want to impose a different
                   outcome. }


                
    }
  
  \item[ Block ] 
    {  
      Blocking is putting a shield between you and an
                  incoming attack.
                   

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ Upon a successful block, a shield's armor
                    values are added to any armor that you are currently
                    wearing }

  (see below). You can attempt to
                    block any incoming attack that you are aware of.
                    Blocking can be used against melee attacks, missile
                    weapons, arrows, gunshots, and unusual attacks such
                    as a fireball or an acid splash. Larger shields will
                    make it easier to block, more info can be found in
                    the shields section.
                   

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ The Shield skill is used for blocking. Blocking
                    means that the blow hits, but the defender gets to
                    add the armor of the shield to his own armor value.
                    }

  In the case of a non-standard attack, such
                    as a splash of acid, the shield simply stops a
                    certain percentage of the damage outright.
                
    }
  
  \item[ Dodge ] 
    {  
     one of the best types of defense. Dodge is an
                   (expensive) skill; dodging is moving your body out of
                   the way of an incoming attack. By sidestepping,
                   ducking, throwing yourself to the ground or similar
                   Action you can avoid any attack completely and take no
                   damage. The Dodge skill is used for dodging. On a
                   successful dodge the blow doesn't hit, period.
                   However, dodge is a high rank skill, so most
                   characters will not be very good at it. 
    }
  
\end{description}
  
    {  
     Now that you know what the types of defenses are, we
               are going to lump them together and call them
               `defense' for the sake of simplicity for what
               is to follow. 
    }
  
    {  
     To defend against an attack, you must succeed at
               your defending skill roll. And you must have MORE
               successes at the attacker had in his attack roll. For
               example, if an attacker has 3 successes to strike you,
               then you would need at least 4 successes at your defensive
               skill to protect yourself. If you have fewer successes
               than the attacker, you are struck by the attack. You can
               only attempt to defend against an attack with one type of
               defense. You can only try to block, dodge, or parry once
               per attack but not multiple of these at a time (i.e. you
               cannot attempt to block and dodge the same attack). You
               can attempt to parry one attack and then dodge the next
               attack, however. 
    }
  
    {  
     If you are struck you will likely take damage from
               the attack. Also note that you cannot defend (parry,
               block, or dodge) an attack that you did not know about!
               
    }
  
    {  
     Note that there are other defensive maneuvers
              aside from Dodge, Parry, and Block. These include
              certain magic spells (Blink, for example), martial arts
              abilities (such as Preemptive Dodge), or supernatural
              powers. Regardless of what defense a character chooses
              to use, only ONE defense maneuver may be used against
              any one incoming attack.\footnote{ Some magical spells or
              super powers of a defensive nature are active for a set
              durationusually several rounds. Such spells, such
              as full barrier, are not defensive maneuvers. These
              spells are independent of defense. A character using
              such a spell may still use a defensive maneuver if she
              chooses to.  Magical spells, martial arts techniques,
              and supernatural abilities are considered defense
              maneuvers whenever they are single-use effects that are
              used against only one specific attack (such as
              Blink).}\footnote{ Some attacks, such as
              automatically targeting magical spells, will strike your
              opponent regardless of defense. Defensive maneuvers are
              ineffective against these spells. For example, Ray of
              Heat as discussed above will always strike its
              target. Call Lightning will always strike its target, if
              the caster succeeds on his magical control roll to cast
              the spell. For these abilities, defensive maneuvers have
              no effect. }
            
    }
  
    

\subsection{Damage}
    
    {  
     When an attack hits its target, it will inflict
               damage upon it. Every weapon has a damage rating
               associated with it as well as a damage type (for example:
               a dagger is a \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\ensuremath{}\textscbf{P} weapon). The damage rating is the
               amount of damage it will do, and the damage type reflects
               how the weapon deals its damage. 
    }
  
    {  
     Here's a key of the different damage types
               with abbreviations in parenthesis and what they are
               typically associated with: 
    }
  
\begin{description}
    
  \item[ Piercing (P) ] 
    {  
      using a sharp tip to penetrate the target
                   creating a hole or deep cut within the target. Some
                   melee weapons, most bullets, and other penetrating
                   weapons deal piercing damage. Armor can protect
                   against this type of damage. 
    }
  
  \item[ Slashing (S) ] 
    {  
      using a cutting edge to slice the target
                   creating a fairly shallow long cut within the target.
                   Most melee weapons such as knives and swords, as well
                   as lasers deal Slashing damage. Armor can protect
                   against this type of damage. 
    }
  
  \item[ Crushing (C) ] 
    {  
      using a heavy blunt edge in an attempt to
                   fracture or break the target. This is typically the
                   hardest damage to protect against, and as such, is a
                   favorite type of damage for melee combat. Punches,
                   clubs, staves, and explosions deal Crushing damage.
                   Armor can protect against this type of damage. 
    }
  
  \item[ Undefined (U) ] 
    {  
      using energy to cause damage within the target.
                   This can include electricity, heat, magic, sickness
                   and other `odd' types of damage. Normal
                   armor cannot protect against this type of damage. Only
                   your character's Base Armor (BA) can protect you
                   from undefined damage. Any time someone takes
                   undefined damage he or she will always take at least
                   one point of damage, regardless of the Base Armor.
                   
    }
  
  \item[ Direct (D) ] 
    {  
      extremely damaging attacks deal D damage. There
                   is no way to protect yourself from Direct Damage, as
                   it will bypass all armor and other protections that
                   you have on. Damage from D attacks is subtracted
                   directly from Hit Points (HP). 
    }
  
\end{description}
  
    {  
     Consider the dagger again: \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\ensuremath{}\textscbf{P} 
    }
  
    {  
     This tells us that a strike from a Dagger deals \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\ensuremath{}damage. Also, we know that it deals piercing damage.
               
    }
  
    {  
     Ok, so now we've got our weapon's damage
               rating and it's damage type. Roll the given damage
               as described in the dice rolling section at the beginning
               of the rules section. The higher the damage roll, the more
               severe the attack was upon the target. 
    }
  
    {  
     After the damage roll is determined, subtract that
               damage from the target's Hit Points (HP). Armor can
               reduce the damage taken, which brings us to...
               
    }
  
    

\subsection{Armor}
    
    {  
     Armor is any covering that you are wearing or behind
               that will absorb some of the damage applied to you. All
               armor is given three numerical ratings for piercing,
               Slashing, and Crushing protection. The higher any one
               number is, the better it will protect you from that type
               of damage. Typically this value sequence is represented as
               P/S/C (Piercing/Slashing/Crushing). An example would be
               3/2/3, which provides 3 points of piercing protection, two
               points of Slashing protection, and 3 points of Crushing
               protection. 
    }
  
    {  
     When taking damage subtract the armor value, which
               matches the damage type of the weapon, from the damage
               amount. 
    }
  
    {  
     Here are a few examples: 
    }
  
  

\quotexample[Carlos vs. the Bandit]{
    {  
     Carlos was attacked by a bandit with a short
                 sword. The bandit made his skill roll to attack and had
                 three successes. Carlos attempts to parry and had only
                 one success. Since Carlos has fewer successes than the
                 attacker, he fails to parry and takes full damage. The
                 GM rolls damage for the bandit and determines that the
                 bandit's sword blow deals 8 damage. Carlos is
                 wearing soft leather armor, which has a P/S/C rating of
                 2/3/0. We know the short sword dealt 8 damage. But it is
                 a Slashing weapon (denoted by the S in the weapon
                 damage), so the armor provides 3 points of protection
                 against this attack. So we take the damage of the weapon
                 (8) and the amount of protection the armor gives (3),
                 and subtract the armor value from the weapon damage. So,
                 Carlos just took 5 damage (8-3=5). 
    }
  }
  

  
  

\quotexample[Lira the Gladiator]{
    {  
     Lira is fighting a gladiator-style duel. Her
                 opponent attacks with a spear and has two successes to
                 hit. Lira wants to block and rolls her shield skill. She
                 has four successes on her skill roll. This means that
                 she successfully blocked the incoming attack with her
                 shield. The GM rolls damage for the attack and gets 14
                 P. (that's a strong blow!) Lira is using a Splint
                 Shield (P/S/C of 9/9/9) and is wearing Hard Leather
                 armor (3/4/1). First, apply the damage against
                 Lira's shield. Her shield has an armor of 9 versus
                 P. This means that her shield stops 9 points of the
                 incoming damage. However, since the spear blow dealt
                 more damage than her shield has armor, the weapon
                 continues through her shieldwhich now has a hole
                 in it. Lira now deals with the remaining 5 damage. (14
                 damage was dealt, minus the 9 taken by the shield = 5).
                 Her armor has a P value of 3, meaning that she only
                 takes 2 points of damage to her HP total. (14 damage - 9
                 from shield - 3 from armor = 2) 
    }
  }
  

  
    {  
     Now that you have that, lets introduce a few tricks.
               The entire next two paragraphs are incredibly important,
               so pay attention! 
    }
  
    {  
     Weapons that deal undefined or Direct Damage (U or D
               damage) bypass all armor values. Undefined damage can be
               protected against by your character's Base Armor
               (BA) sub-attribute. Just subtract the BA from the damage
               taken as if the BA was normal armor. Note that Base Armor
               is not used for protecting against anything but undefined
               damage! A target will always lose at least one HP when hit
               with an attack that deals undefined damage. 
    }
  
    {  
     Direct Damage cannot be protected against. Not by
               normal armor, Base Armor, not anything. It's harsh,
               so be careful when on the receiving end of something that
               deals D damage. D damage is applied directly to your Hit
               Points. 
    }
  
    

\subsubsection{Armor Piercing}
    
    {  
     Some weapons have a note that says
                 `AP' followed by some number. This kind of
                 weapon has an unusual ability to pierce armor. If an
                 armored target is struck by a weapon with
                 `AP', the armor is reduced by the AP number
                 for the purposes of damage calculation. Note, that this
                 cannot go negative. If an `AP: 10' weapon
                 strikes someone wearing 5 armor, then the armor is
                 totally ignored. It does not, however, go to -5. 
    }
  
  

\quotexample[Lira Strikes With Gladius]{
    {  
     Lira is wielding a gladius, which is a type of
                   short sword that has AP: 5. She successfully strikes
                   her opponent, and rolls 11 damage. Her opponent has an
                   armor of 7 versus Slashing damage. First, deduct the
                   AP from the armor: 7 armor - 5 AP = 2. Then, deduct
                   the armor from the damage like normal: 11 damage - 2
                   armor = 9 damage. Lira's opponent takes 9
                   damage. 
    }
  }
  

  
    {  
      Consider the same situation as above, but assume
                 that Lira's opponent's armor is only a 3
                 versus Slashing. First, deduct the AP form the armor: 3
                 armor - 5 AP = -2. However, this cannot be negative, so
                 we cap it at zero. Now, deduct the result from the
                 damage: 11 damage - 0 = 11. Lira's opponent takes
                 all 11 damage. 
    }
  
    {  
     AP is effective against armored targets, but it
                 does nothing against unarmored targets. Note, that most
                 weapons with AP don't deal very much damage. It is
                 usually a good idea to use AP weapons versus armored
                 targets only, and use `normal' weapons
                 versus unarmored targets. 
    }
  
    

\subsubsection{Fire (F)}
    
    {  
     Some weapons and spells have a note that says
                 `F', `Fire', `Fire
                 Effect', or 'U Fire'. These weapons
                 deal fire damage. Unless stated otherwise Fire weapons
                 deal U damage. As well, Fire effect weapons will ignite
                 the target, as well as readily flammable materials
                 within a 3' radius of the blow. A target that is
                 `on fire' will suffer an extra \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\ensuremath{}\textscbf{U} damage
                 each turn that the fire is still going. This starts on
                 the `next' turn after the target is struck.
                 Certain types of armor have Fire Protection. This means
                 that this armor has the unique ability to resist heat
                 and the damage caused by fire-effect sources. If a
                 target with fire protection is struck with a fire-effect
                 attack, damage dealt from the fire is zero and the
                 target is not ignited. Fire protection on armor will
                 only work three times before the armor must be repaired
                 or replaced. Some armor is rated fire protection
                 \begin{math}\times \end{math}2, which will take six
                 fire-effect hits before loosing it's fire
                 resistance, etc. Note that fire protection armor only
                 resists the ignition effect and any heat (U) damage
                 from the fire specifically.  Therefore, if a weapon
                 deals normal damage (P/S/C) AND has either Fire
                 effect or Fire damage (U) then the fire-related
                 effects are prevented but the standard damage (P/S/C)
                 is treated as normal. Targets that are `on
                 fire' suffer the damage on each of their
                 turns.

                   takes 11 damage from the C portion of the blow, but

\subsection{Combat with Different types of Weapons and Effects}
    
    {  
     Apathy includes rules for combat with melee weapons,
               ranged weapons, firearms, magic, and so forth. The rules
               for attacking and defending with different kinds of
               weapons and effects are detailed here. 
    }
  
\begin{description}
    
  \item[ Hand-to-Hand attacks: ] 
    {  
      Hand-to-hand attacks include things like punches,
                 kicks, and body weapons (teeth, claws, etc.).
                 Hand-to-hand combat may be Parried, Dodged, or Blocked.
                 
    }
  
  \item[ Melee Weapons: ] 
    {  
      Melee weapons are handheld weapons that are not
                 thrown or launched. This includes swords, knives, axes,
                 hammers, most polearms, etc. Melee weapon attacks may be
                 Parried, Dodged, or Blocked. 
    }
  
  \item[ Missile Weapons: ] 
    {  
      Missile weapons are archaic type weapons which
                 are thrown or launched at the target. This includes
                 throwing knives, thrown spears, arrows, crossbow bolts,
                 sling bullets, etc. Missile weapons may be Dodged, or
                 Blocked normally but may not be parried (except for
                 special abilities that may allow one to parry them)
                 
    }
  
  \item[ Projectile Weapons: ] 
    {  
      Projectile weapons are guns, shotguns, rifles,
                 pistols, lasers, particle beams, and other fast moving
                 kinetic weapons. Projectile weapons may be Dodged or
                 Blocked, but NOT Parried. 
    }
  
  \item[ Explosives: ] 
    {  
      `Explosives' in this case includes
                 such things as grenades, molotov cocktails, bottles of
                 acid, etc. These attacks may be Dodged or Blocked. Note,
                 these attacks have a blast radius. If the defender has 1
                 more success than the attacker, it means that a direct
                 hit was avoided but the defender still suffers the
                 radius damage. If the defender has two or more successes
                 over the attacker it means the entire attack was
                 defended against. If the attacker ties or beats the
                 defender then the defender takes full damage. Note that
                 most true explosives, such as grenades, missiles, or
                 bombs, deal double damage on a direct hit and normal
                 damage in their blast radius. 
    }
  
\end{description}
  
    

\subsection{Hit Points}
    
    {  
     Hit Points are numbers used to represent how injured
               or healthy a character is. A character will have TWO Hit
               Point numbers. Your maximum Hit Points determines how
               tough your character is at full health. This number will
               rarely change. It is determined by your BLD and WIL
               attributes, and will rarely change unless your attributes
               change. 
    }
  
    {  
     Your current Hit Points is the most important number.
              It will likely change frequently during combat. Hit Points
              are generally represented as a fraction: \begin{math}{{
              Current HP}\over{Max HP}}\end{math} . When the
              game begins, your character will be fully healthy and
              uninjured. Thus, when starting, your current HP will be
              equal to your maximum.
            
    }
  
    {  
     As you get injured, any damage you take (after
               applying armor, etc.) will be applied to your current HP.
               As you get injured, your current HP drops. Over time, your
               body will heal itself, and your HP will go up. Seeking
               medical attention will speed this process. Other things,
               like magic or cybernetic devices, can heal you as well.
               
    }
  
    {  
     Your current HP can never exceed your maximum HP. As
               a general rule for minor injuries (less than 5 HP), you
               gain back 1 HP per day of average activity. For
               significant HP losses, it takes \begin{math}  
                    {   (   Maximum 
                      -   Current   )  
                     }^{ 2 }    \end{math}  days to fully recover your HP.
            
    }
  
    {  
     If a character is resting and is under basic medical
               care, then your healing time is cut in HALF. If your
               character is under the care of a professional Doctor or
               Healer, healing time is cut to one QUARTER of normal time.
               
    }
  
    {  
     If your current HP falls below 0, your character
               falls unconscious. It is possible to remain conscious by
               making a willpower check at -X, where X is the amount
               below zero your HP are. If your current HP are below 0,
               your character is bleeding badly (internal bleeding is
               possible too) and you will loose 1 HP per round, unless
               you receive medical attention. If your current HP ever
               reaches the negative of your maximum HP, you have died.
               
    }
  
    

\subsection{Called Shots}
    
    {  
      Whenever a character attacks he is aiming for the
               most convenient blow that he can make. It is assumed that
               this is a `center mass' attack: In other
               words, the attacker hits the largest, most obvious,
               portion of the target's body. For humans and most
               animals this is the torso area. 
    }
  
    {  
      However, there are times when a character may want
               to strike a specific part of the target's body.
               Attacks that are aimed at a specific portion of a target
               are called shots. Called shots may be attempted with any
               kind of attack or weapon. The attacker must be able to see
               and identify the exact target that he is trying to hit.
               
    }
  
    {  
      When performing a called shot the attacker must
               declare in advance that he is making a called shot, and
               where he is aiming. It takes one action for the character
               to identify and focus on the specific target that he wants
               to hit. A called shot always incurs a strike penalty.
               Consult the called shot table on the reference sheet for
               the appropriate negative. If the attacker fails his strike
               roll, then the attack missies completely. (It does not,
               for example, hit `normally' as opposed to the
               called target). If the attacker makes his strike roll,
               then the target may defend as normal. 
    }
  
    {  
      A called shot cannot be attempted with an
               auto-targeting magic spell, such as Ray of Heat; these
               effects always strike `center mass'. However,
               called shots may be attempted with magical spells that
               require a roll, such as Fireball or Call Lightning.
               
    }
  
    {  
      The effects of a called shot are left up to the GM
               to resolve on a case-by-case basis. The effects would
               depend on the location of the called shot and also the
               amount and nature of the damage dealt. 
    }
  
  

\quotexample[Philip misses the troll]{
    {  
      Philip has engaged a troll in combat, and
                 declares that he wishes to make a called shot, aiming
                 for the troll's head. The GM assigns a strike
                 penalty of 8 for the called shot. Philip fails
                 his strike roll, and therefore misses the target
                 completely. 
    }
  }
  

  
  

\quotexample[Morgdar is fighting a lizardman.]{
    {  
     He attempts to make a called shot targeted at the
                 lizardman's eye. He successfully makes his called
                 shot and the lizardman fails to defend. The GM asks that
                 damage be rolled. Morgdar's spear deals 3 damage.
                 The GM rules that enough damage has been dealt to put
                 out the lizardman's eye, thereby preventing it
                 from attacking properly in combat. The GM notes that had
                 Morgdar rolled higher damage, then the blow could have
                 been instantly lethal. 
    }
  }
  

  
    

\subsection{Cover}
    
    {  
      Cover is something that a character or a creature
               is obscured by. Cover has two effects: 
    }
  
\begin{enumerate}
      
  \item 
                
    {  
      Cover can make a target, or a specific part of a
                 target, difficult to see and therefore difficult to hit
                 in combat. 
    }
  
              
  \item 
                
    {  
     Cover can act like armor, which can reduce or even
                 prevent damage that would otherwise harm a target.
                 
    }
  
              
\end{enumerate}
  
    {  
      A target has cover if there is something between
               the attacker and the target. This something could be
               foliage, walls, other combatants, etc. The exact amount of
               cover should be determined by the GM. A target has total
               cover when the target is completely obscured by the
               covering object. In the case of total cover, the attacker
               cannot see the target. 
    }
  
    {  
      An attacker has two options when confronted with a
               covered target. 
    }
  
    {  
      Attempt to strike around cover: The attacker takes
               aim at part(s) of the target that are not behind cover.
               This assigns a negative to the attacker's strike
               roll, which is determined by the GM. Refer to the
               reference sheet for sample strike penalties for cover. The
               attacker may also attempt a called shot against a portion
               of the target's body that is not behind cover using
               the normal called shot negatives. If the attacker fails
               the strike roll, then the attack misses, period. 
    }
  
    {  
      Attempt to strike through cover: The attacker
               strives to hit the target like normal, trusting that the
               weapon will penetrate the cover and strike the target
               anyway. When doing so, the attacker has a 2 to
               strike regardless of the severity of the cover. This
               2 is in addition to any other penalties that might
               be present as well. Then, deduct the armor value of the
               cover from the damage dealt by the attack, just as if the
               defender were using a shield. 
    }
  
    {  
      A target that has total cover is completely hidden,
               and may not be targeted at all. 
    }
  
    {  
      A magic using character may still attack using an
               auto-targeting spell if ANY portion of the target's
               body is visible. This incurs no strike penalty whatsoever.
               However, if the magical effect is impeded by the cover,
               then damage may be reduced. 
    }
  
    {  
      The act of ducking behind cover will give a bonus
               to Dodge rolls. However, the cover does not provide a
               strike penalty or armor unless the targeted character was
               already behind the cover before the attack started (in
               which case there is no dodge bonus). 
    }
  
    {  
      Targets that are actively attempting to hide behind
               cover are often restricted in their movements. When using
               cover, defenders are at 3 to all defensive maneuver
               rolls that they choose to use. Note that if the cover is
               sufficiently large then it doesn't require any
               special effort to hide behind it. In this case there is no
               penalty to defensive maneuvers. 
    }

                 her crossbow, she has 8 to strike, OR she may
                 choose to make a called shot against some part of the
                 troll that is not behind cover. In that case she must
                 take the called shot penalty for whatever target she

                 has dense cover, and thus Mikus has 12 to strike
                 him. Mikus decides he'd rather take chances with
                 the armor value of the car's door rather than try
                 and shoot the gangster at such a high penalty. Mikus
                 takes aim at where he thinks the gangster's body
                 is situated behind the car doorthereby incurring
                 a 2 for attempting a shot through cover. Mikus
                 makes his roll. Rolling damage for his .224 BOZ, he
                 deals 19 damage. The car's door provides 8
                 armornot enough to stop the bullet. The
                 unfortunate gangster suffers the remaining 11 damage.

\chapter{Augmentations}
    
    

\section{Additions}
    
    {  
     There are two basic types of addition augmentations.
             The first are small devices that don't take up a lot
             of room. These are easy to add to the body because they
             don't require any power or a lot of space. As a
             general rule, this type of augmentation is very small and
             its function is often limited. 
    }
  
    {  
     The second type are larger, complex systems, which
             take up a lot of space in the body. Generally, the only way
             to add something like this to your body is to remove, move,
             replace, or otherwise modify some other part of your body in
             order to accommodate it. This works on a system of slots
             (see below) which is similar to the Mecha system. 
    }
  
    

\section{Replacements}
    
    {  
     Augmentation replacements, in their most basic forms,
             are exactly the same function-wise as normal body parts. Of
             course, many augmentation parts are upgrades of some sort.
             They might be stronger, faster, or more durable than normal.
             Some augmentation replacements have new functions or
             different abilities than normal. 
    }
  
    

\section{Augmentation Limbs and Bodies}
    
    {  
     Entire limbs or even entire bodies may be replaced
             with augmented versions. There are two basic types of
             replacement limbs and bodies: Robotic or Cybernetic. 
    }
  
    {  
     Robotic limbs are built entirely from non-organic
             materials. They are machines made of steel, high-tensile
             alloys, wires and high pressure hoses. Movement comes from
             hydraulics, electric motors, gears and levers. Robotic body
             parts contain no flesh or blood. 
    }
  
    {  
     Cybernetic limbs are basically organic. They consist
             of bone, tendons, and muscles just like
             `natural' limbs. However, cybernetic limbs are
             enhanced with technology including electric implants,
             genetically modified tissues, and some synthetic material
             reinforcements. 
    }
  
    {  
     These rules apply to cybernetic and robotic
             components: 
    }
  
    

\subsection{Robotics}
    
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   Do not bleed when injured (though they might leak
                 oil or make sparks) 
  \item   Have unnatural heat signatures 
  \item   Do not look or feel realistic in the slightest;
                 rather they look like machinery. 
  \item   Take double damage from electrical sources.
                 
  \item   Are immune to disease, poison, and magical
                 effects that work on living targets (a robotic body part
                 is not alive). Note that this means that healing magic
                 or typical healing/medical items have no effect on
                 robotics. 
  \item   Have double the HP of non-robotic parts. 
  \item   Robotic limbs cannot be upgraded directly. They
                 can, however, be easily removed and replaced with
                 upgraded parts. 
  \item   Used robotic parts generally have high resale
                 value and demand. Used parts are regularly available.
                 Many robotic parts are interchangeable. 
  \item   Robotic parts are considered fairly easy to
                 replace and repair. Some parts can be swapped in a
                 matter of minutes. 
  \item   Robotic parts do not heal automatically. If
                 damaged, repairs must be made by a mechanic or by
                 replacing the damaged parts with new ones. 
\end{itemize}
  
    

\subsection{Cybernetics}
    
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   Bleed when injured 
  \item   Appear normal when viewed casually, or on thermal
                 sensors. Many cybernetic limbs will appear 100\% normal
                 even under close visual inspection. However, inspection
                 by a knowledgeable person (Doctor, Nurse, Cyber Doctor,
                 etc.) will reveal the true nature of the limb. 
  \item   Usually feels realistic to the touch, but not
                 necessarily. 
  \item   Are fully susceptible to disease, poison, and
                 life-affecting magic just like any other living tissue
                 (cybernetic body parts are living tissue) 
  \item   Cybernetic parts can be upgraded at a later date
                 without total replacement. However, this usually
                 requires surgery. 
  \item   Cybernetic parts are usually built around the
                 user's body. Used cybernetic parts are valuable,
                 but the potential market is limited to those people who
                 are very similar to the original owner. Therefore the
                 used cybernetic parts market tends to be flooded with
                 supply for which it is difficult to find a buyer. It is
                 often time consuming to find a donor or source for a
                 particular part. Cybernetics parts prices for both
                 buyers and sellers will vary wildly depending on market
                 conditions, which are nearly impossible to predict.
                 
  \item   Repair to cybernetic limbs is a combination of
                 electro-mechanical work and traditional medicine.
                 Repairing significant injuries or adding/removing
                 cybernetics often entails surgery, a hospital stay, and
                 may well require lengthy recovery time. 
  \item   Minor injuries to cybernetic limbs heal just like
                 injuries to a normal human. Magical healing and
                 regeneration works for cybernetics in most cases, though
                 healing may be incomplete if the damage is severe.
                 
\end{itemize}
  
    

\section{General Augmentation Rules}
    
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   All humanoid characters have, by default, (size)
               free slots in the body. These are assumed to be located in
               the torso. (Humans, which are size 2, start with +2 slots)
               If you want more slots to store things in, you have to
               purchase augmentations that give you back additional
               slots. 
  \item   After all augmentations are chosen for a character,
               add up the slot total. This number must be positive. (In
               other words, augmentations cannot be installed unless
               there are slots available to house those parts) 
  \item   A robotic limb may be attached to any kind of
               torso. However, a cybernetic limb can only be attached to
               a natural (non-robotic) torso. This is because all
               cybernetic limbs depend on the support organs and blood
               supply found in the torso. 
\end{itemize}

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Anti-armor (arrows only!)}
\ruledesc{ A special type of
           arrowhead designed to penetrate heavy armor. They are
           expensive and time-consuming to produce, and therefore
           generally rare for military use (at least by common soldiers).
           The forged and hardened point is square or triangular in
           profile, carefully ground into a very sharp point.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Barbed}
\ruledesc{ Common for hunting
           small game (especially birds), and also used for war. This is
           a standard arrow (bullet point) with several metallic barbs
           embedded in the head. It is difficult to remove, causing
           additional damage when it is pulled out of the target.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Broadhead (hunting)}
\ruledesc{ These are the most
           effective hunting arrows. They aren't great at
           penetrating heavy armor, but are excellent for causing
           additional damage to the target. This is particularly
           desirable for hunting, because it is likely to kill or
           incapacitate the target animal quickly, even if the vital
           organs are missed. A broadhead is a wide, diamond-shaped head
           that has two or more `fins' on it that are
           sharpened into bladeswhich cut a devastating wound in
           the target.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Bullet Point}
\ruledesc{ The
           `standard' type of arrow point. The tip is
           pointed, but somewhat blunt, like a rifle bullet. They are
           used for hunting small game, and for target shooting. They are
           also common arrows for some military use since they are easily
           and cheaply produced.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Bullet Point
           (blunttarget)}
\ruledesc{ A common military
           arrowhead. This is also the most common type of dart. The head
           is made of steel, and fashioned into a narrow conemuch
           like a pencil. These types of arrows are generally not used
           for hunting, but are very effective for wartime use.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Explosive}
\ruledesc{ A rare arrow
           design, which features a hollow head packed with gunpowder or
           other light explosive. When it strikes the target, it makes a
           small explosion. This has excellent damage potential.
           Unfortunately, the large, fragile, head makes this type of

\section{Armor}
    
    

\subsection{Basics for Armor and Damage}
    
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   Armor has 3 main values: Piercing, slashing, and
                 crushing. Armor values are represented by 3 numbers
                 separated by slashes (represented by: P/S/C;
                 piercing/slashing/crushing). Example: Armor with values
                 of 4/3/7 would have 4 points of protection vs. Piercing,
                 3 vs. Slashing, and 7 vs. crushing damage. 
  \item   Armor does not protect from Undefined (U) or
                 Direct (D). 
  \item   A character's Base Armor is the only thing
                 that can protect vs. U damage. Nothing can protect
                 against D damage. 
  \item   All non D/U damage has an associated damage type
                 to is; either P, S, or C. Subtract all matching armor
                 values of the character from the damage being done. If
                 the damage value is still above 0, then the character
                 takes that amount of damage. 
  \item   A weapon with an armor piercing (AP) attack will
                 list the amount of AP it has. Subtract this AP number
                 from all of the armor's damage values when
                 determining its protection against the attack. This
                 cannot drop the armor's value below 0. 
  \item   GMs determine when armor is damaged beyond
                 use/protection. 
  \item   Hard Armor is any armor that uses hard
                 ceramic/plastic/metallic/wooden plates or coverage to
                 protect the character. Hard armor is MUCH more durable
                 than non-hard armor. Hard armor is denoted by
                 `hard' on the armor sheet. Note that the
                 components of hard armor are hard. They can't be
                 bent without damaging the armor. Hard armor is generally
                 made specifically for the wearer, it will only fit
                 others with nearly identical body proportions. 
  \item   Soft armor (armor that isn't considered
                 hard) is at least somewhat flexible. It will generally
                 fit anyone of similar size/stature. 
  \item   Armor with the descriptor of `fire'
                 has fire protection. This means the armor has the
                 `natural' ability to deflect and protect
                 against fire attacks. The armor will protect from all
                 fire damage (assuming the fire hits the armor, so full
                 suits are better for this). 
  \item   Armor can be layered, but only one hard suit can
                 be worn at a time. A person can have different hard
                 armors on different parts of the body. Non-hard armors
                 can be layered indefinitely. Add all armor values of the
                 armors together to give the full armor protection. If
                 any armor has fire protection, fire will be stopped, but
                 any armor on top of it is still susceptible to the fire.
                 
  \item   Encumbrance is determined by: BLD/3 
  \item   A character can wear (without penalty) as much
                 armor in size levels as his Encumbrance score will
                 allow. Add up all layers of armor to get the complete
                 Size level of the armor, if this number is equal or less
                 than Encumbrance, then no negatives are given to the
                 player. 
  \item   When a character has more armor than his
                Encumbrance (ENC) allows, then the player has the
                following penalties against him:
                
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   -2 DEX per pt over ENC 
  \item   -1 action per 2 full points over ENC 
\end{itemize}
    
              
  \item   An armor's Class is a general idea of what
                 period of history/future the armor would appear. A later
                 period can find the earlier armor. 
\end{itemize}
  
    

\subsection{Shields}
    
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   When creating a shield, there are 2 factors. The
                 material the shield is made of, and the type of shield.
                 Choose both of these values when creating a shield to
                 get the full set of statistics for the shield. 
  \item   On a successful block, a shield will subtract its
                 appropriate armor value from the damage. Any damage that
                 penetrates the shield will then be applied against the
                 user's armor. 
  \item   Shields can be used to block U attacks that are
                `thrown' at them. These include fireballs,
                lightning strikes, breath weapons, chemical splashes,
                etc. To block one of these attacks, the user must make a
                block roll at -3. If successful, then damage will be
                reduced based on the type of shield:
                
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   Buckler: Full damage 
  \item   Small: \begin{math}{{ 1 }\over{ 4
                   }}\end{math}
                  
  \item   Large: \begin{math}{{ 1 }\over{ 2
                   }}\end{math}
                  
  \item   Tower: \begin{math}{{ 3 }\over{ 4
                   }}\end{math}
                  
\end{itemize}

\section{Energy Weapons}
    
    {  
      Most energy weapons are powered by a battery pack.
             These are interchangable between weapons. Energy within the
             packs is consumed as the weapon is fired, like normal
             bullets. They are called `batts' or
             `b-paks' in slang. B-paks store energy in units
             of EU. Different weapons consume EU at different rates.
             Smaller weapons use 1 EU per shot. Larger weapons might use
             more. Pistols can hold ONE pack. Rifles/cannons can usually
             hold 3. B-paks can be recharged. Recharging a pack takes
             about thirty seconds per EU that has been used. As a general
             rule, it costs \$1 per EU to have pack recharged. HD paks

             \$1.50 per EU to charge.

    {  
      For damage type listed as X/Y, the weapon can deal
             either type of damage for a given attack. For a P/S weapon,
             the attcker can choose to do a P or S attack. For every
             point of STR under Min. STR, the attack gets -1 damage and
             -2 to strike/parry. STR Req is the minimum strength required
             to wield the weapon. For every point of STR over the
             Strength Requirement, add one point of damage to the raw
             roll, up to a maximum of the MSB (Max Strength Bonus) A raw
             bonus is always indicated with square brackets. So \ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}\textscbf{}[\ensuremath{\texttt{+}\ensuremath{4}}]would be a normal \ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}roll, with an additional 4
             added to the final result. When wielding a 1-H weapon with
             two hands, assume the wielder has +2 STR.

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ 2-Headed Axe}
\ruledesc{ The tool of a
           professional woodsman. The double-headed axe offers more
           weight and a backup cutting edge to help power through wood
           chopping chores. It also proved more effective on the
           battlefield than standard axes.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Axe}
\ruledesc{ A typical
           axea tool for chopping and spitting wood. Many
           conscripted soldiers found their farm axes to be devastating
           in combat, often proving more effective than some swords.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Berzerker Axe}
\ruledesc{ The strongest
           Nordic warriors often wielded huge, oversized, versions of the
           their typical war axe. Equipped with a double-edge head and a
           design that concentrates most of the blade weight towards the
           end of the weapon, the Berzerker axe is unequaled for damage
           potential. However, its massive size limits its use to the
           strongest heroes.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Firemans Axe}
\ruledesc{ A tough, heavier,
           superior version of a normal axe designed for enabling rescue
           crews to quickly enter buildings. The fireman's axe has a
           spike on the back of the axe-head, enabling it to be used as a
           piercing weapon as well.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Hatchet}
\ruledesc{ A small axe used
           for breaking up firewood and light-duty farmwork. Though not
           intended as a tool of war, hatchets served many a warrior as a
           backup weapon.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Heavy Battle Axe}
\ruledesc{ Some of the
           strongest medieval knights depended on heavy battle axes to
           deliver maximum damage to their enemies, human or otherwise.
           The heavy battle axe is designed for the roughest combat
           conditions, equipped with a massive, broad, headand the
           weight to carry it through it's target.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Light Battle Axe}
\ruledesc{ An adaptation of a
           wood-chopping tool to an implement of war. Light enough to be
           carried by most soldiers, yet capable of dealing high amounts
           of damage, light battle axes were favored weapons of many
           medieval armies.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Lochaber Axe}
\ruledesc{ An oversized
           battle-axe subscribing to the idea that more weight equals
           more damageand rightly so. The Lochaber axe's
           massive blade deals huge damage, and the spiked backside can
           deal a very nasty piercing attack.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Nordic War Axe}
\ruledesc{ Developed by the
           fiercest Norse barbarian tribes, this is a simple yet fearsome
           weapon. Forged from the superior steels of the northern
           countries, the huge swept blade would easily cleave armor and
           limbs alike, and the carved handle provided for a very
           controllable swing. Many Norse warriors named their war-axes
           such things as `widowmaker' or
           `swordbreaker'.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Pickaxe}
\ruledesc{ A common tool for
           mining, digging, and general construction applications. The
           pickaxe is a heavy tool with a large, pointed, head. It is
           effective for breaking up rocks during mining, and breaking up
           armor in combat.}\vspace{1ex}

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Broadsword}
\ruledesc{ Another common
           European sword. This weapon has a fairly short, wide, blade.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Claymore}
\ruledesc{ A famous weapon of
           Scottish origin. This blade requires a very strong person to
           wieldeven two handed, but deals impressive damage to
           match. Claymores generally have a blade 5..6 feet long. The
           long reach of the claymore makes it effective for engaging
           multiple targets at once.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Espandon}
\ruledesc{ A slender Spanish
           sword, rather like a large saber. Many of the world's
           greatest swordsmen relied upon this weapon to quell their
           foes.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Flamberge}
\ruledesc{  A fearsome
           sword with scalloped, flame-like, blade edges. Sure to inspire
           terror in your enemies, before you cut them down where they
           stand.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Grand Saber}
\ruledesc{ A weapon with
           exceptional deadliness and grace. The five-foot blade requires
           a very strong warrior to wield, but reciprocates with
           exceptional damage potential.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Grand Sword}
\ruledesc{ The largest
           traditional sword. The grand sword appears much like a great

           inches in length, and is shaped to be a natural extension of
           the warrior's arm. Like the Wakizashi, the superior edge
           of this weapon makes it fearsome in combat. A true Katana
           wielded by a skilled warrior can cut through a steel pipe or a
           large wooden post.}\vspace{1ex}

\subsubsection{Notes: specific to Plasma Weapons}
    
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item  Plasma weapons are a bladeless handle (typically
                   looks like a normal weapon handle or a flashlight)
                   from which a glowing blade of extremely hot plasma
                   vents forth. The plasma is held in the shape of a
                   cylinder (or blade) by a magnetic field. They take an
                   action to turn on. 
  \item  Due to the difference between using a plasma
                   weapon verses normal weapons, they require the Archaic
                   Weapons - Energy skill to use. Anyone can use their
                   normal sword skill (or axe skill respectively) but
                   will get a critical failure on a 4 or below (instead
                   of the normal 1). 
  \item  Plasma weapons cannot be parried by non-plasma
                   weapons, likewise, they cannot parry non-plasma
                   weapons. Similarly, shields cannot block plasma
                   weapons. Plasma weapons can parry other plasma
                   weapons, and force fields protect against them as
                   normal If a plasma weapon comes in contact with
                   another one, there is a 25\% chance the magnetic fields
                   of the blades will lock together. It is easy to tell
                   if combatants are locked as an extremely bright glow
                   emanates from the contact point of the weapons.
                   Getting out of a lock requires an action where a
                   strength contest ensues. If there is more than a
                   difference of 8 between the two strength rolls, the
                   lock is broken and the loser loses his or her next
                   action. If no break occurs, the combatants must
                   attempt again on the next action. Either combatant in
                   a lock can turn off their weapon, in which case he or
                   she automatically loses the lock challenge, and gets
                   the same negative as if he lost due in a STR contest.
                   
  \item  One side effect of having a magnetic field
                   around the blade, is that it is possible to parry
                   projectile energy attacks (such as shots from a beam
                   rifle). Doing so the wielder is at a -8.

\subsection{Rocket Assisted}
    
    {  
      Rocket-assisted weapons are modern versions of
               traditional archaic weapons. They have small rocket motors
               contained in the weapon. When the weapon is swung, the
               motor ignites, giving extra force to the blow. They are
               used with the same skill as normal archaic weapons.
               
    }
  
    {  
      If such a weapon is used, and the target is missed,
               then it takes an extra two actions to recover. If the
               target is hit but the blow is parried or blocked, then it
               takes the normal time to recover. 
    }
  
    {  
      When using rocket assisted weapons, you need an
               extra success to parry melee attacks. (At least two better
               than attacker.) 
    }
  
    {  
      Each weapon can store up to 5 `rocket
               charges.' When these are used up, they must be
               refilled before the weapon can be used. Each charge costs
               \$100 to refill.

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Blow Gun - Long}
\ruledesc{ A hollow tube,
           fashioned from wood or metal, which is used to shoot small
           darts by means of blowing into one end. Blowguns deal very low
           damage intrinsically, but are very effective for delivering
           poisons to the target. Many primitive tribes rely on the
           silent attack of the blowgun to hunt animals for food.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Blow Gun - Short}
\ruledesc{ See Blow Gun -
           Long}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Bolo}
\ruledesc{ A simple tool used
           for capturing animals. The bolo is a bundle of long cords tied
           together in a common knot. The free ends of the cords are
           tipped with weights. The bolo is whirled around the head and
           then thrownupon striking, the cords are likely to
           entangle the target's legs. Though not thought of as a
           common weapon of war, bolos have been used in combat, and can
           be very useful.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Composite Bow}
\ruledesc{ A composite bow is
           one that is made from multiple layers of wood that are glued
           together. It also has a semi-recurve design. This creates a
           bow that is significantly more durable and more powerful than
           a smaller bow. They are about 4..5 feet long.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Compound Bow}
\ruledesc{ A modern variation
           of the archaic bow. The compound bow has a pulley system
           attached to the string, which provides increased velocity.
           They generally have a very high draw weight, but are designed
           so that once they are pulled back, the weight the shooter has
           to hold while aiming is far less than the actual power of the
           bow. Though some archaic bows are more powerful, the compound
           bow is much more durable and more compact.}\vspace{1ex}

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Crossbow - Heavy}
\ruledesc{ A bow made from

           Crossbows range in size from the small pistol-sized ones
           through larger ones used for hunting and war, through the
           largest sizes, which are so powerful they require a mechanical
           crank to cock them. Crossbows always require one action or
           more to load. Modern crossbows are made from composite
           materials, and even the larger sizes are fairly light and
           easily carried.}\vspace{1ex}

\ruledesc{}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Hunters Bow}
\ruledesc{ A variant of the
           short bow optimized for hunting. It is of similar size, but is
           made of more flexible wood and has a larger draw length. It is
           designed so that it is powerful, but isn't too large to
           carry while stalking game. This bow can kill larger deer,
           antelope, etc.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Long Bow}
\ruledesc{ A much heavier bow
           developed by the English. A true Long bow is made from Yew
           wood, and is at least six feet long. When equipped with the
           proper arrows, it can penetrate full plate armor.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Recurve Bow}
\ruledesc{ A recurve bow is
           one that has been specially treated so that the bow itself
           `wants' to bend in the opposite direction
           that it actually does when drawn. This puts more force on the
           bowstring therefore equates to a more powerful bow.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Short Bow}
\ruledesc{ A common bow used
           for hunting, target shooting, or combat. The short bow is
           generally four feet long. It can be used to hunt animals
           weighing less than a man.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Sling}
\ruledesc{ The weapon used by
           David to slay Goliath. A sling is a simple leather or cloth
           strip with a pocket in the center. The pocket is loaded with a
           stone, or other object, and the sling is whirled about the
           head and released, sending the stone flying at high speed.
           Slings deal decent damage, and are very simple to create. They
           are often used to harass enemy troops, or to launch various
           nasty substances into enemy ranks.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Slingshot}
\ruledesc{ A very simple
           modern weapon. The slingshot is a Y-shaped frame, often made
           from wood, into which a thick rubber band has been mounted.
           The slingshot is held in one hand, while the other hand loads
           the band with your choice of missile, and stretches it back,
           then firing. Slingshots are so simple children often make
           them. Professionally made slingshots, which fire metal balls,
           can be quite powerful, and can kill in the proper hands. They
           are effective for hunting small game.}\vspace{1ex}

\section{Introduction}
    
    {  
      Magic exists in many forms. It is a supernatural
             energy that permeates everything in the world. Characters
             with the right skills can bend this energy to their
             willand perform amazing feats in the process. Magic
             is capable of healing the sick, raising the dead, creating a
             great fireball, protecting the caster from harmand
             nearly anything else you can imagine. 
    }
  
    {  
      Magic, whatever type it might be, is all about
             manipulating MANA. Mana, as mentioned above, is a
             supernatural energy that is present in everything. It is in
             the air, the ground, in your food, even in your body. Mana
             is what is responsible for `enforcing' physical
             laws such as gravity, etc. When a person uses magic, they
             are manipulating mana to do what they want. Normally, this
             is the mana that is in their own body. It is possible to
             work with mana outside one's body as well. Nobody
             really knows exactly how mana works, but special gestures
             and body movements handed down throughout time are believed
             to initiate complex quantum-mechanical events that result in
             seemingly impossible things taking placemagic.
             
    }
  
    {  
      Mana is found in all things. However, more mana is
             found in some things than others. Gases (air, for example)
             have very little mana. Denser substances such as water and
             stone have more mana. Complex things such as man-made
             objects (pottery, woodcarvings, machinery, etc.) contain
             quite a lot of mana. Living things, from mice to humans to
             whales, contain even more mana. Mana is released back into
             the environment when living things die, or when mana-rich
             objects decay, are burned, or broken. Other objects tend to
             `soak up' mana that is released near them. Thus,
             older items tend to contain more mana than do
             `new' ones. Whenever an item is broken it is
             possible to extract some of its mana as it dissipates back
             into the environment. This is also possible when a living
             creature dies. In game terms, we call mana `MP'
             (Mana Points / Magic Points).

\section{Types of Magic}
    
    

\subsection{Invocation Magic (spellcasting)}
    
    {  
      Invocation spellcasting is the most common and
               basic form of magic. This is the art of the wizard and
               sorceress, where characters use innate mana to cast
               spells. Invocation spells are based on methodical,
               practiced, gestures and chanting of magical incantations.
               
    }
  
    {  
      Incantation magic is learned. The invocation
               magician will have a list of spells that she has studied
               and memorized. As long as she has mana (MP) available, she
               may cast any spell that she knows. Because invocation
               magicians use innate mana and well defined, repeatable,
               forms it is the easiest type of magic to learn. 
    }
  
    {  
      Spells are learned from other magicians, studious
               research, or a combination of the two. Research requires
               access to various books on the subject of magic, including
               book(s) that are specifically about the spell to be
               learned. True books on magical subjects are few and far
               between, and books about high level spells are extremely
               valuable. Invocation magicians have invented a special
               language to record and describe magic spells and the
               procedures required to cast them. All true magical books
               will be written, at least in part, in this special
               language. Wizards and Sorceresses might hail from
               different countries, races, and moral
               standpointsbut they all share common ground in the
               ability to read magical script. Magical script is
               specially designed to describe and transcribe magical
               spells, therefore it is rarely used for other purposes. It
               is difficult to carry on a conversation, written or
               spoken, in the language of magic. 
    }
  
    {  
      More often than not a wizard will belong to a
               particular clan or school, where many wizards pool their
               knowledge and references for members to share. In such
               situations there will usually be more experienced
               spellcasters that may teach their skills to junior
               members. Wizards may be children of existing wizards or
               they might be apprentices or students at an established
               wizard's school or place of business. Wizard secret
               societies are common as well. Some are devoted to
               particular schools of magic. Others are devoted to a
               certain cause and happen to share arcane secrets to persue
               common goals. Wizard secret societies and wizard schools
               are places where other wizards can learn new spells and
               find magical items. However, most magic secret societies
               have a strict hierarchy and code of conduct. Special
               oaths, tithes, and obedience to the order are often
               required, and favors always entail repayment. 
    }
  
    {  
      Spells are purchased (learned) similar to skills.
               However, there are no levels for spells. A character
               either knows a given spell, or they don't. If you
               like you can think of this as a `level 1
               skill'. 
    }
  
    {  
      There exist different schools (aka categories) of
               magic. Some Wizards specialize in certain schools, but
               that is purely optional. Any character may learn spells
               from any categorybut with the following
               restrictions. A character may only learn a given spell if
               she knows at least one spell of lower rank from the same
               school. As well, the rank of the spell must be no higher
               than your Spellcasting skill level. For example, you
               cannot learn a rank 4 `Air' magic spell unless
               you already know a rank 3 `Air' spell, AND you
               must have Level 4 or higher Spellcasting. 
    }
  
    {  
      You can learn any spell, regardless of type, if you
               have a spellcasting skill at least three levels higher
               than the rank of the spell. For example, if you have a
               spellcasting skill level of 6, then you could learn any
               spell of rank 3 or lower, regardless of school or
               prerequisite lower-rank spell. 
    }
  
    {  
      A character with level 1 or higher spellcasting can
               always learn Rank 1 magical spells from any school without
               restriction. 
    }
  
    {  
      Note that a Wizard or Sorceress character must have
               at least one level in Magical Studies in order to read
               spell books and to learn the intonations required for
               magical incantations. Beyond that Magical Studies is a
               purely optional skill. 
    }
  
    {  
      Characters that cast Invocation magic must have at
               least two free points of Encumberance available. If not,
               they are not able to cast magic. 
    }
  
    

\subsection{Ritual Magic}
    
    {  
      Ritual magic is performed in elaborate
               `performances' involving a much human
               involvement. Magic rituals involve material components
               (ingredients) and a great deal of chanting, mumbling,
               gesturing, and the like. The traditional image of a witch,
               bent over a bubbling cauldron containing newt eyes and
               salamander toenails is a good example of ritual magic.
               Whereas traditional spellcasting is an almost scientific
               pursuit, ritual magic is more of an art. Rituals are
               conducted with a trained eye and experience. Because
               ritual ingredients vary in quality and potency, precision
               has little use. Ritual magicians are shamans, witches and
               warlocks. 
    }
  
    {  
      Ritual magic is not religious. In fact, it is no
               more religious than making a bowl of oatmeal or mixing
               some cement. However, in many cultures ritual magic is
               heavily associated with religion, especially in primitive,
               animistic, or tribal societies. In these cultures ritual
               magic is the domain of the `witch doctor' or
               `medicine man'people who hold important
               positions in the tribe, often including that of a kind of
               priest or spiritual leader. Therefore, there is a strong
               association between ritual magic and primitive, pagan,
               religions. Many ritual magicians are religious figures,
               members of mysterious cults, etc. Some ritual magicians
               have been known to practice animal or even human sacrifice
               (an excellent, though horrific, source of MP for rituals).
               In these societies ritual magic is often believed to be
               religious in nature despite the fact that it is decidedly
               not. 
    }
  
    {  
      Ritual magic users do not use innate MP to perform
               magic. Rather, they use material components (ingredients)
               to create magical effects. Performing rituals requires a
               large amount of space and various supplies and components.
               Ritual preparation and casting is a time consuming and
               often messy proposition. Therefore, most ritualists have a
               set area where they can store their materials and perform
               rituals: usually a quiet location away from prying eyes.
               This might be a purpose-built room in the home or a secret
               `lair' in a basement or abandoned building. It
               might even be a cave or hidden woodland grotto. Such an
               area is a very personal space for the ritualist, and while
               it might be neatly organized or highly messy, it will be
               arrayed exactly how its owner prefers. 
    }
  
    {  
      Most ritual supplies are re-useable, and a
               ritualist's `kitchen' will be well
               stocked with such items. These include such things as
               wands, knives, scales, measuring devices, a fireplace,
               cauldrons, bottles, pots, strainers, mirrors, precious
               gems, candles, assorted tools, and so on. Approximately
               \$1000 * Rank worth of supplies is required in a
               ritualist's `kitchen'. (In other words,
               in order to perform the Ritual Stoneform, which is a rank
               6 spell, \$6000 worth of supplies are required to be on
               hand) These supplies are reuseable and are used for many
               different rituals. 
    }
  
    {  
      Specific spells require different ingredients.
               Ingredients could be nearly anything, including herbs and
               roots, body parts (animal and human), minerals, chemicals,
               plants, and so forth. Some of these are common and will be
               used for many different spells. Others are quite specific
               and rare, and have very specific applications. A ritualist
               will usually have a personal stockpile of ingredients and
               components stored away. This stockpile will usually
               include all but the most expensive of components. Of
               course, some components can be difficult to find and some
               must be fresh, so any ritualist will definately have the
               means to locate components that she needs. Some components
               might be gathered personally, through the use of skills
               such as herbalism, alchemy, hunting, or scrounging. Other
               components are purchased by the ritualist. Some components
               may be purchased at common merchants while others must be
               purchased from special (and sometimes illicit) vendors.
               Most ritualists will have known connections through which
               different components and supplies might be shared,
               purchased, or loaned. 
    }
  
    {  
      The cost of ingredients for a particular spell is
               approximately 1/10 of the `scroll or potion'
               cost from the spell chart. This assumes fair prices in an
               open market. However, this cost might vary greatly
               depending on various circumstances. For example, in a
               certain town components for Fire spells might be common
               and therefore very inexpensive, while components for Earth
               spells might be rare and therefore much more expensive.
               
    }
  
    {  
      In addition to its specific `recipe',
               any ritual spell will also require the infusion of mana.
               As mentioned above, in ritual magic the MP does not come
               from the caster. The caster must gather objects containing
               sufficient MP to conduct the spell. As mentioned above,
               mana is present in nearly everything, but generally not in
               sufficient quantity to do any good. Therefore, the
               ritualist must seek out items that are rich in MP to use
               when conducting a ritual. This process results in the
               destruction of the items used! This might even entail the
               sacrifice of living thingsif such an amount of MP
               is required. Generally, items yielding MP for ritual use
               will cost about \$1 per MP required, though this will vary.
               Much like individual spell components, a ritualist will
               tend to hoard items that may be sacrificed for MP. Common
               items are living plants and small animals, antiques, old
               artwork, fossils, old holy items, old clothing (especially
               from special occasions) and well-used household goods.
               MP-source items are not spell-dependant. MP items can be
               used for ANY spell. 
    }
  
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   NO MP from the character are required for ritual
                 magic 
  \item   Each spell's components cost 1/10th of the
                 `scroll/potion' cost from the spell table,
                 PLUS \$1 for each MP required. Components are consumed
                 and can only be used once. (note that costs are
                 approximate and should be determined by the GM) 
  \item   The time required to prepare for a given ritual
                 is equal to Rank-1 hours. Once preparations are made,
                 the ritual must be conducted within 12 hours or the
                 preparations are wasted and must be begun again.
                 Preparation uses up one half of the required ritual
                 ingredients. 
  \item   The time required to perform a given ritual is
                 [Time] minutes. Conducting the ritual itself must be
                 done within 12 hours of preparations being made, and
                 uses up the remaining half of the ritual ingredients.
                 
  \item   Ritual spells cost 1 less Rank to learn than
                 normal 
  \item   Ritual magicians learn free rituals as they gain
                 levels in Ritual Magic, according to the chart below;
                 note that they are free to purchase other spells as they
                 desire.

    {  
      Ritual magicians may also perform a ritual in a
               special manner, infusing the spell into an object, such as
               a weapon or magical totem. Infusing a spell takes the same
               amount of time as performing the ritual in normal fashion.
               Once the spell is infused in an item, it may be released
               very quickly. Releasing a charge (the energy and magical
               effects of a stored ritual) requires 1 action, regardless
               of the original casting time of the spell. Infused ritual
               items are only good for twenty-four hours, at which point
               the charge is lost and the item returns to normal. The
               ritualist may create charges of extended duration when he
               first performs the infusion, but each 24 hours of time
               requires another batch of the requisite spell ingredients
               (not Mana). Therefore, it can become very expensive to
               make long duration infused items. An infused item may be
               used by anyone, not just the ritualist. 
    }
  
    

\subsection{Religious \& Faith Magic}
    
    {  
      Religious magic is magical effects that are brought
               into reality by the combined will of the caster and the
               caster's god(s). Whereas primitive religions and
               cults tend towards the use of ritual magic, Religious or
               Faith magic is practiced by priests of clearly defined and
               well organized religions. Most religions that practice
               Faith magic have a clearly organized hierarchy within the
               church. Religious dogma and/or scripture is well defined
               and is extensively documented. Faith-magic using religions
               are not necessarily `good', but they are
               usually known to the general public and often actively
               recruit new members. 
    }
  
    {  
      Religious magic is taught by a particular Church.
               Each faith has one or more magic schools associated with
               it. These nearly always include Spiritual and Life magic,
               and may include others. Most faiths have 3 or 4 schools of
               spells. A faith caster has access to all spells in the
               school(s) associated with his Faith, except those whose
               rank is higher than his level of faith, and those which
               are specifically prohibited by his Church. For example, a
               `good' tending religion would typically deny
               harmful Life-magic spells to their adherents, for example
               curse. 
    }
  
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   MP are consumed as normal spellcasting 
  \item   A holy symbol is required for religious magic
                 casting 
  \item   A successful Faith check must be made for casting
                 faith magic. 
\end{itemize}
  
    {  
      Priests, monks, and warriors of faith practice
               religious magic. All religious spells are channeled
               through a holy symbol (see below). 
    }
  
    {  
      Once a day the caster must engage in prayer. The
               exact means of praying is left up to the players \& GM,
               but during this time the priest will choose which spells
               he as access to for the remainder of the day. The caster
               may choose any combination of spells he has access to,
               provided that he has enough MP (at the time of prayer) for

               and spells during this prayer session. Until the next
               prayer session those are the spells the caster may use. A
               holy symbol of at least +0 quality is required for this
               prayer, otherwise the caster cannot allocate spells for
               that day.

               trinket often suffices. There are different types of holy
               symbols. `Better' and more significant holy
               symbols offer a better bonus to Faith magic casting:

\subsection{Martial Magic / Super Power Combat}
    
    {  
      Martial magic is the ability to perform
               supernatural `attacks' in conjunction with
               normal combat, such as fist fighting, martial arts, or
               combat with weapons. 
    }
  
    {  
      Martial Magic always works in conjunction with some
               kind of verbal or somatic component. This means that the
               fighter must perform a particular combat form (kata),
               stance, or must shout a particular phrase in order to use
               the ability. 
    }
  
    {  
      Martial magic is always taught from master to
               student. It is a closely guarded secret of warrior secret
               societies, secluded martial arts temples, or families with
               great fighting traditions. Once a warrior masters the
               traditional (non-supernatural) combat arts, he may be
               taught martial magic. Since martial magic is highly
               dependent on particular combat forms and stances, it is
               nearly impossible to learn on one's own or from a
               book. 
    }
  
    {  
      Magical effects that ordinarily require touch do so
               for the martial magician as well. This is normally done by
               striking the target with some kind of melee attack. The
               character does not have to deal damage per se (if the
               target is wearing armor) but he must connect with a solid
               blow. The magical energy (effect) is transferred through
               the blow. Martial magic users may choose to use a normal
               touch instead. 
    }
  
    {  
      Magical effects that are projectile in nature (such
               as Fireball) and normally require a strike roll must be
               used in conjunction with a missile or projectile weapon of
               some kind (thrown weapon, arrow, dart, or even a bullet).
               
    }
  
    {  
      Magical effects that are autotargeting when
               performed by a spellcaster (such as Lightning Bolt) are no
               longer autotargeting. The Super Power combatant must
               strike with any attack of his choice, which may be a
               ranged attack or a melee attack. 
    }
  
    {  
      The effects of a martial magic spell are in
               addition to those normally associated with a strike in
               combat. If a martial artist punches a target and also
               performs the spell Vampiric Drain, then the target will
               suffer normal damage from the Punch, as well as the damage
               and effects from Vampiric Drain. Likewise, if a martial
               magician shoots a target with an arrow in conjunction with
               Energy Blast, then both the arrow and Energy Blast deal
               damage. 
    }
  
    {  
      Martial magic works similar to spellcasting, with
               the following notes: 
    }
  
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   MP are consumed just like spellcasting 
  \item   Touch spells require a successful strike roll in
                 combat 
  \item   Ranged spells require a missile weapon of some
                 kind 
  \item   Auto-target spells are now `cast' by
                 a WIL check of the user 
  \item   Martial Magic spells are learned/purchased just
                 like normal Spells 
  \item   Martial Magic users must have at least 1 level in
                 Mysticism 
\end{itemize}
  
    {  
      Rather than purchasing the Spellcasting skill, a
               Super Power Fighter adds together his skill level of
               Martial Arts and Mysticism. The total is considered the
               skill level of `Martial Magic' 
    }
  
    

\subsection{Mysticism / Psionics}
    
    {  
      Psionics is the ability to perform magic or
               supernatural acts by pure force of will. No incantations,
               materials, or special preparation is required. A character
               that can perform these feats is called a Mystic. 
    }
  
    {  
      Whereas most magic users have trained to develop
               their abilities, Mystic characters are more often
               `gifted' with magical abilities. Quite often
               these powers manifest themselves as a result of a
               traumatic event, such as a near-fatal accident, that is
               experienced by the character. They may also be abilities
               that are passed down through a particular familyin
               which case the character is simply born with his unique
               powers. Mystic characters have an innate ability to
               perform their abilitieswhich are completely
               independent of any kind of structured `method'
               or `technique'. While mystic characters might
               join magical societies they cannot `learn' or
               `teach' mystic techniques to others. Psionic
               abilities are something that a mystic discovers herself.
               
    }
  
    {  
      Mystic rules: 
    }
  
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   MP are consumed just like spellcasting 
  \item   No verbal, somatic, or material components are
                 required. A mystic can be totally still and silent and
                 can sill use his abilities, though the time required to
                 perform (use) a mystic ability is exactly the same as
                 standard spellcasting. 
  \item   Spells are purchased from the spell list at will.
                 There is no need to follow a particular category. The
                 only restriction is that learned spells must be no
                 higher level than the character's Mysticism skill.
                 
  \item   Mystics always use the WIL attribute for
                 magic-related rolls, such as Magical Control, regardless
                 of the normal attribute that would be used for that
                 roll.

\subsection{Beast Magic (summoning)}
    
    {  
      Beast Magic is a unique magic school. It is the art
               of summoning creatures to aid their master. Any magic user
               (spellcasting, ritual, etc.) may purchase summoning spells
               as normal. However, a spellcaster that specializes in
               Beast Magic (and has no other magical aptitudes) may
               purchase summoning spells as if they are one rank lower
               than normal.

               to be summoned. A summoner can attempt to summon multiple
               of the same creature simultaneously, but not a mixture of
               different creatures. The caster has a bonus to this check
               based on what `Beast Lore' skills he knows.

\subsection{Magic-Related Skill Summary}
    
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item   Spellcasting gives additional \begin{math}    
                    {LVL}^{ 2 }   \times  WISMP
                         \end{math} . This is the governing skill
                      for learning Invocation spells.
              
  \item   Magical Studies is the academic study of magic
                 and how it works. It also gives the player the ability
                 to identify magical items or effects (a simple skill
                 test), and to determine what a particular magical
                 item/effect does (GM determines difficulty of the test).
                 It also conveys the ability to read and write magical
                 script. This skill does not convey the ability to use
                 magic; this skill does not provide MP. 
  \item   Magical Control gives additional \begin{math}    
                    {LVL}^{ 2 }   \times    WIL  
                      \times     2   MP  
                       \end{math} , and is used to strike with and to control
                      the effects of some spells. While this skill is not
                      required for magic use, it is commonly used.
              
  \item   Mysticism gives an additional \begin{math}    
                    {LVL}^{ 3 }   \times    WIS  MP
                         \end{math} . This is the governing skill
                      for learning Mystic / Psionic spells.
              
  \item   Faith is not technically a magic skill. However,
                 it is used for Faith magic, and provides \begin{math}  
                    {LVL}^{ 2 }   \times    WIL  
                      \times    {{ 3 }\over{ 2
                      }}  MP    \end{math} . Faith
                      only provides MP to those characters who actually
                      know Faith magic spells. If a non-faith spellcaster
                      has this skill (For example, a Wizard that also
                      happens to be religious) then it does NOT provide
                      any MP.
              
  \item   Ritual Magic is used for Ritual Magic spells. No
                 character can learn a ritual spell with a higher rank
                 than her level of Ritual Magic. This skill does not
                 provide MP.

\section{General notes}
    
    {  
      Most spells automatically succeed (there is no skill
             check necessary, except for Faith Magic). Once cast, it is
             possible for some spells to miss their target however. For
             these spells, the player must make a skill test using
             Magical Control (or Faith) to determine if the strike is
             successful. See the spell listing for what spells are
             auto-targeting and which aren't. 
    }
  
    {  
      If the player is interrupted while spell casting (e.g.
            takes damage, gets knocked around, etc.), he must make a
            skill check (Magical Control). If he fails the check, the
            spell fails, but the MP are not lost.
              

\textscbf{Note!} \textbf{ The caster may not speak while spellcasting, but may
               move around, dodge, and perform very simple physical
               activities. }


          
    }
  
    {  
      A spell always takes effect at the end of the casting
             period. The MP are consumed at the exact instant that the
             spell takes effect. 
    }
  
    {  
      A casting time of zero (0) means that the caster may
             cast the spell anytime, even in response to something (e.g.
             getting shot at), or having no actions remaining at the
             time. Such spells require no command words, components, or
             gesturing of any kind. 
    }
  
    {  
      Note that a Faith magic caster must always make a
             Faith roll in order to cast any magical spell. 
    }
  
    

\subsection{Magic Points (MP)}
    
    {  
      Any character has innate MP; magic related skills
               will give additional MP.

\subsection{Magical `Tools': Books, Scrolls, and
               Potions}
    
    {  
      There exist three different kinds of magic-related
               books. 
    }
  
    {  
      Type 1 is a volume that contains detailed
               information on how to cast a particular spell (or spells).
               Books of this type are always written in magical script.
               Anyone with the Magical Studies skill can read and
               understand this kind of book. However, only those with
               Spellcasting can make real use of the contents. A
               Spellcasting character can easily learn new spells from a
               book of this type. Books of this type are very valuable.
               The cost of a spell book like this is equal to the
               `Book' price column of the magic table. If the
               book contains multiple spells, then its value is equal to
               the sum of the costs for each spell contained. Generally
               speaking, books of this type only contain multiple spells
               when they are compendia of low-level spells in a given
               school of magic. 
    }
  
    {  
      Type 2 is a volume that describes how to perform a
               particular spell in ritual format. Books of this type
               might be written in any language, and are generally not
               written in magical script. If a Ritual magic using
               character can read a book of this type, it is something
               like a cookbook for a particular ritual spell. The
               character could keep the book as a reference or could use
               it to learn the ritual described. Ritual spell manuals are
               worth approximately one-quarter the cost of a Type 1 book.
               
    }
  
    {  
      Type 3 is a book that describes other forms of
               magic. Since Faith magic, Martial Magic, and Mysticism are
               dependant on the individual `casting' the
               spell and not on some external `formula' or
               `recipe', it is essentially impossible to
               truly document how to perform a given spell with nothing
               more than a book. These books are of interest to sages and
               scholars who are interested in arcane subjects. However,
               they are little more than a curiosity to actual
               practitioners of magic. Given enough books of this type it
               is possible for a sufficiently advanced magical
               practitioner to figure out a new spell or technique, but
               it is no guarantee. Books of this type are worth
               approximatley one-tenth of the listed price, depending on
               the exact subject matter contained within the volume. They
               may be written in any language. 
    }
  
    {  
      Magical potions or scrolls are single-use magic
               spells. Anybody can use a potion or scrollwhether
               they know anything about magic or not. Spells that affect
               the caster or a willing recipient are potions. Drinking
               the potion causes the spell to take effect. Other spells
               take the form of scrolls. Reading the scroll aloud causes
               the spell to take effect. Both scrolls and potions are
               single-use only. Potions can be drunk in one action.
               Scrolls ALWAYS take 3 actions to use regardless of the
               spell. 
    }
  
    {  
      A person with Magical Studies can create Books,
               Scrolls, and Potions of any spell he/she knows. Producing
               such works is a long and expensive process:

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{Name}
\ruledesc{Description thereof.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Air Laser}
\ruledesc{ This spell fires a
           thin beam of compressed gas and wind from the caster's
           outstretched hand. The beam is very hard to see becasue it
           looks like a hazy distortion in the airit is very
           nearly transparent. The beam may be fired at any target within
           100 feet range. Air Laser has AP: 50 and is at a +3 to strike.
           Note: this spell is not actually a laser in the true sense of
           the word, thus it is not affected by typical laser defenses.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Air Scythe}
\ruledesc{ The caster
           enchants a bit of air surrounding one target, forming it into
           an invisible cutting blade. The blade automatically strikes
           the target. This spell is only effective if the intended
           target is surrounded by air. It is ineffective in an air-free
           enviornment, such as in space or underwater.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Ball lightning}
\ruledesc{ The caster charges
           a ball of electricity between his hands and then throws it
           forward in a direction of his choosing. The ball travels in a
           straight line from the caster towards its intended target. The
           ball can travel no more than 150 feet away, or to the intended
           target, whichever is closer. The ball explodes into a flash of
           lightning and sparks whenever it strikes its intended target
           or reaches its maximum range in the event of a miss. This
           deals \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{10}\ensuremath{}\ensuremath{\times{}5}\textscbf{U} damage to the target and anything occupying
           the target square. This spell does not have the Fire effect
           though it will ignite readily flammible materials in the
           target square. Furthermore, any creature that is within 10
           feet of the path the ball travels (except the caster) is
           struck by a small lightning bolt dealiong \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{10}\ensuremath{}\ensuremath{\times{}2}damage.
           (roll this damage seperatley for each target harmed in this
           manner) The final target does not suffer this damage in
           addition to the normal target damage. The caster may throw the
           ball through hard objects or through "friendly" targets by
           making the ball disappear and reappear along its path. The
           ball can pass though inaninmate objects or open areas 15'
           or less in size and then reappear without stopping it or
           diminishing it's effect on the target if the caster makes
           a magical control check for each object or space he wishes the
           ball to skip.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Call Lightning}
\ruledesc{ Caster calls down
           a single lighting bolt from the sky, which strikes the target.
           It has a 50\% chance of fire effect. This spell is only
           effective outdoors. If this spell is cast on a stormy day, it
           deals double damage and the caster gets +3 to his strike roll.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Chain Lightning}
\ruledesc{ The caster fires a
           bolt of lightning from his outstretched arms. The bolt
           automatically strikes one target, dealing \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{10}\ensuremath{}\ensuremath{\times{}5}damage. The
           bolt then immedietly jumps to another target within 40 feet of
           the first, dealing 4x \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{10}\ensuremath{}, etc. The bolt keeps jumping, each
           time losing 1x damage. The bolt jumps four times for a total
           of five different strikes. Chain Lightning can jump to the
           same target more than once, as long as the target wasn't
           the target of the previous strike. Each lightning jump always
           strikes the closest possible target from its previous jump,
           unless the caster makes a Magical Control check to redirect it
           elsewhere at -1 for each 5 feet between the closest target and
           the caster's preferred target.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Corona}
\ruledesc{ The caster
           conjures up a field of intense lightning energy, fire, and
           sparks which fills one 5-foot square (which must be a valid
           target) and four surrounding squares (a cross shape). Anything
           in the area of effect of the spell suffers \ensuremath{2}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{10}\ensuremath{}\ensuremath{\times{}5}\textscbf{U} per turn
           for the duration of the spell. Also, on each of the
           caster's turns one randomly determined target within
           20' of the area of effect is struck by a lightning bolt
           dealing \ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{10}\ensuremath{}\textscbf{U}.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Create Smoke}
\ruledesc{ Generates a large
           cloud of dense black-gray smoke filling 50,000 cubic feet.
           (50x50x20), which then dissipates naturally. This smoke is not
           hazardous or unpleasant to breathe, though it does obscure
           vision.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Deflection}
\ruledesc{ Deflection
           enchants one target with a field of anti-gravity. This has the
           following effects on the target: +3 levels to dodge skill (and
           similar skills based on dodge) +3 to any DEX or skill rolls
           related to jumping or avoiding objects. +2 levels to parry +2
           levels to block (shield skill) -6 to strike with melee attacks
           -3 to other types of DEX checks or skills involving manual
           dexterity or manipulation of small objects.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Electric Bolt}
\ruledesc{ Caster forms a
           small bolt of lighting in his/her hands and sends it flying
           towards any one target. (has a 50\% chance of fire effect)}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Electrospark}
\ruledesc{ Caster manipulates
           air molecules to create an electrostatic discharge wherever he
           chooses. It doesn't have fire effect, but it can ignite
           very flammable materials such as gasoline, lamp oil, dry
           tinder, natural gas, etc. Target must be within 20' of
           caster. Caster can use touch to strike with the spell
           automatically.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Energy Field}
\ruledesc{ Generates an area
           of highly charged air. Electronic devices in the field such as
           appliances, cellular phones, computers, or walkie-talkies have
           60\% chance to fail in operation. Furthermore, static
           electricity in the area will move about lightweight objects
           and fine particles are likely to become stuck to anything
           moving in the area.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Explodet}
\ruledesc{ A powerful spell
           that forces the air immediately surrounding one target to
           undergo immediate and complete mass-energy transformation,
           creating a powerful explosion with the target inside it. X is
           the size of the target.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Focused Gust}
\ruledesc{ Creates a short
           gust of wind in a random direction centered at a location the
           caster chooses. It applies force equal to 10*X*Y lbs. Y is the
           size level of the object the spell is cast on. If the caster
           spends double MP he can choose the direction of the gust. This
           spell cannot cause damage directly, but can knock things over.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Gas Slash}
\ruledesc{ One target is
           struck by several narrow streamers of high pressure gas.
           Target is struck a total of X times. Reroll damage for each
           strike.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Grand Storm}
\ruledesc{ After casting, a
           dark, foreboding, storm blows into the region. For the
           duration of the spell, the caster can spend one action to call
           down from the sky a bolt of lightning dealing \ensuremath{3}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{10}\ensuremath{}\ensuremath{\times{}10}\textscbf{U} damage
           to any target that is outside; all objects within 10 feet of
           the target take half damage from this strike. In addition, for
           the duration of the spell the caster can take an action to
           throw a bolt of lightning from his fingers dealing \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{10}\ensuremath{}\ensuremath{\times{}5}\textscbf{U}
           damage to the target, and all objects that are lined up behind
           the target for up to 50 feet.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Great Bolt}
\ruledesc{ The caster calls
           down a large bolt of lightning from the sky, striking one
           target. (fire effect). Anything within 5' of the strike
           takes half damage. This only works outdoors.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Heavy Spark}
\ruledesc{ Caster launches a
           bolt of lightning from his/her outstretched hands, which
           attacks a single target.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Invert pressure}
\ruledesc{ Invokes a gas
           explosion within the target}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Lightning Gauntlet}
\ruledesc{ One of the
           caster's forearm and hand is surrounded by a sheath of
           electricity. Anything the caster touches with the gauntlet
           takes listed damage. Due to the size of the gauntlet, the
           caster gets a +1 to strike with it (use unarmed combat, or
           similar skill to strike).}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Lightning Stream}
\ruledesc{ A large column of
           lightning streams out from the caster. The stream can be a
           maximum of 100 feet long, and deals \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{10}\ensuremath{}\ensuremath{\times{}5}\textscbf{U} damage to all
           that are caught within the stream. Only large, inorganic,
           nonmetallic objects (e.g. stone wall, hill, etc.) can stop the
           lightning stream. For the duration of the spell, the caster
           can use an action to re-point the spell so that it can damage
           a different set of opponents.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Pressure shift}

           Ward so that he can open the box unharmed. Because Major Ward
           is \begin{math}{5}^{th}\end{math} rank, Disenchant does not automatically work, and
           a skill contest is required. Even though Ulek is dead,
           `he' is still entitled to a roll. The GM
           determines that Ulek had Magical Control level 4 and WIL 15 at
           the time Major Ward was first cast. Thus, Uleks roll is
           4 dice + 15 (from wisdom) and +5 from the spell level. The GM
           keeps this information secret, and rolls for Ulek: Three
           successes. The evil wizard now rolls: He has Lvl 5 Magical
           Control, a WIL of 14, and he chooses to spend an extra 250 MP
           which gives him +5 to his roll. His roll is 5 dice + 19, and
           comes up four successes. Because the evil wizard wins the
           skill contest, disenchant is successful and Major Ward
           disappears.

           forth. Make a Magical Control check to see if the spell
           effects posions of a magical nature. This spell has no effect
           against living creatures or infectious organisms such as
           bacteria/diseases/viruses. Note that this spell may bring
           temporary relief to victims of bacterial diseases becasue it
           eliminates any toxins that may be present. However, it does
           not eliminate the root cause of the illness in that case.}\vspace{1ex}

           one target with an aura of positive energy. Target recives +1

           target can be resurrected in this fashion. If the caster dies,
           the target's life thread is severed and the target dies.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Deathly Haze}
\ruledesc{ Causes direct
           biological damage in one target, and poisons the target. The

           creature with a death curse. Once the spell is cast the curse
           takes effect, indicating to the target how much time it has
           left to live. After \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}turns the creature must roll a BLD
           check at -5. Failure means instant death and there is a 50\%

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Poison}
\ruledesc{ Caster corrupts

           will remove the attribute and skill penalties.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Regeneration}
\ruledesc{ This spell greatly
           accelerates the natural healing processes of one target,
           boosting the target's vitality and closing wounds at a

           \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\texttt{+}\ensuremath{1}HP per turn. Furthermore, this spell allows severed
           limbs to reattach if the limb is held against the stump. Any

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Regrowth}
\ruledesc{ This is a
           specialized healing spell which forces the body to regenerate
           new organs and limbs. Casting this spell will regrow any
           single limb, appendage, or organ, except for the brain. This
           is effective even if the body part is missing entirely (such
           as a severed limb), or is damaged due to disease or injury.
           This spell also heals sensory deprivation such as blindness,
           deafness, or inability to speak even if there is no obvious

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Reincarnation}
\ruledesc{ Brings one dead
           target back to life as a random creature. The type of creature
           is determined by the worth of the target reincarnated. A
           target who has proved its worth (not necessarily good worth)
           will be brought back to life as a creature greater than it
           was. If the target was found unworthy, it is brought back as
           some creature less than it was. This check of worthiness is
           determined by the GM, as is the type of creature the target is
           reincarnated into. Requires at least some remains of the
           target to be reincarnated.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Restore}
\ruledesc{ Magical curing

           target dies (which may be immedietly) they cannot be
           resurrected. If cast on a target that is already dead, the
           target can no longer be resurrected. Pulse of Life, if

\ruledesc{Description thereof.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Autophase}
\ruledesc{ Caster's body
           becomes permeable to normal matter. He may pass through walls,
           etc. at will, and can interact with objects as he chooses.
           Caster, however, walks on floors, stairs, etc. as normal, if
           he so chooses. While this spell is in effect, caster is
           totally silent and cannot speak or hear.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Barrier}
\ruledesc{ Creates a
           hemispherical two-way magical barrier 8 feet in radius.
           Physical attacks penetrate at half damage Magic/Psionics
           unaffected. Barrier can be made one-way for double cost.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Blink}
\ruledesc{ This spell is a
           defensive maneuver. When cast, the caster disappears and
           instantaneously reappears in random location within 20 feet of
           original location. Roll randomly to determine the
           caster's new location. Note that Blink will not put the
           caster into an iminently dangerous spot such as in the air
           over a chasm, into a fire, or over a puddle of lava. However,
           Blink may cause the caster to reappear closer to an opponent.
           This spell functions as an automatic dodge. In other words, it
           will allow the caster to automatically avoid being struck by
           any one targeted blow. Dodge is effective against physical
           attacks, ranged and melee weapons, projectiles, and magic
           spells that require a roll to strike. Blink is NOT effective
           against auto-targeting magic spells (the caster simply gets
           hit in his new location). Blink is also not effective against
           area-effect spells or area-effect weapons (such as a grenade),
           unless the caster's new location happens to be outside
           the area of effect. Just like the Dodge ability, the caster
           must be aware of the attack he wishes to Blink from. Blink
           therefore cannot be used to avoid sneak attacks that the
           caster did not know about.}\vspace{1ex}

           then the spell instantly expires. The cup can contain anything
           that a glass or ceramic cup could normally contain including
           liquids, powders, or small objects. The cup does not transmit
           heat or chemical effects, so it can be used to safely carry
           lava, acid, red-hot metal, poison, or other dangerous

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Magic Missile}
\ruledesc{ Caster magically
           propels a small object towards one target at high speed.
           Damage depends on type of object thrown; usually C. The object
           must fit in the palm of the hand and must weigh no more than 1
           lb. After striking the target, the object falls to the ground
           naturally. The caster must have an object to propel with this
           spell. Note that even if a "weapon" is used as the projectile
           (such as a throwing knife), the damage remains \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{6}\ensuremath{}, though the

           if he so chooses. When fixed, the pole remains held in
           position magically until the spell expires. Applying in excess

           protection) has no effect versus this spell}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Biting Frost}
\ruledesc{ Freezes the ground
           (or floor) in a given area no larger than 200 square feet.
           Anything in the area becomes stuck to the ground, as icy

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Breathe Water}
\ruledesc{ Allows the target
           to breathe water as if it were normal air. This works with
           both fresh and salt water. Note that if the character is
           inhaling dirty water then the character may be affected by any

           to swim long distances or to deep depths becasue the character
           does not have to return to the surface to breathe. However, it
           does not convey extraordinary swimming ability.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Create Water}
\ruledesc{ Caster can create
           pure water from his fingertip. 1 liter is created per 1 MP

           The water provides armor of 10/15/20 while the spell is in
           effect. Fire magic or attacks with fire effect will damage the
           coating. If 50 HP are dealt by fire damage the spell ends. The

\section{Rules}
    
    {  
      Martial Arts covers the use of all weapons (ranged,
             melee, ultratech, mecha, et al.), in addition to
             hand-to-hand (HtH) combat, and the set of specialized skills
             that are associated with the Martial Arts governing skill.
             The maximum level that any character may have in any Martial
             Arts skill is less than or equal to his level in Martial
             Arts, i.e. if he has 3 Levels in Martial Arts, then all of
             his Martial Arts skills must be Level 3 or less. The basic
             Martial Art skill confers upon the martial artist the
             ability to purchase the different skills listed in this
             section. 
    }
  
    {  
      For each level the martial artist has in Martial Arts
             they may choose one Martial Arts skill; for this skill, any
             time the martial artist would have to roll the skill, they
             get an extra die to do so. A skill may only be chosen
             Level-in-Martial Arts/2 times (the Lvl in Martial Arts,
             divided by two, rounded-down). 
    }
  
  

\quotexample[Kim improves his Nyrkkeily]{
    {  
      Kim NGoc Goay is an expert in Norse Boxing
               (Nyrkkeily), he chooses, when he gets his first level in
               Martial Arts, he also buys a level in
               `Punch/Kick;' in particular, he also assigns
               his level-bonus to `Punch/Kick.' This means
               when he rolls to strike with a punch he rolls two dice and
               not one. 
    }
  }
  

  
    {  
      After the Martial Arts skill has been purchased,
             skills from the four basic categories may be acquired; the
             four categories represent different capabilities that
             Martial Arts covers. The five categories are Basic, Combat,
             Defensive, and Modifier. The different categories focus on
             different phases of Combat, such that Combat skills are
             designed to aid the Martial Artist with movement,
             entering/exiting combat, the knowledge of combat,
             deployment, and higher-level strategy. Basic skills are
             involved in the nitty-gritty (basic) postures and moves to
             actually strike the opponent and inflict harm or death.
             Defensive skills are designed to deflect, dodge, and/or
             otherwise avoid the mishap of being harmed by another
             pugilist. Modifiers represent ways to modify Basic skills.

\section{Further Commentary}
    
    {  
      You will note that there is no `chi' or
             `super-powers' in Martial Arts. In fact, the
             skills are deliberately kept pedestrianthose
             possessed (or assumed to be possessed, if possible) by the
             greatest `non-mystical' martial artists in the
             real world.' This is done deliberately to
             provide a clear separation between the
             Supernormalgoverned by Magic and Traitsand the
             mundane reality of kicking, spitting, biting and hurting. If
             you want to create a character that has truly jaw-dropping
             magical abilities, like flying-through the air, or punching
             through a fired-brick wall, bending steel, or leaping from
             roof-top-to-roof-top, consider looking into the Magic and
             Traits section. In Magic there a several categories that
             would benefit a Martial Artist tremondously. 
    }
  
    

\subsection{Advanced Martial Arts}
    
    {  
      Also there are several para-skills which are
               tremondously important to the dedicated Martial Artist:
               Kata, Kung Fu, Waza, and Jitsu. These skills allow the
               Martial Artist to transform his very Basic and Defensive
               attacks, allowing him to perform prodigious feats: a
               Savage Feinting Death Strike is only possible by using
               these skills.

           purchase an individual skill for them. For example, the
           Zaghnal is Exotic, in order to use the Zaghnal, a character
           must purchase the specific skill Zaghnal. Exotic skills
           may be specialized.

	   In addition, any
           non-Exotic and non-Chained weapon can be used as a blunt
           weapon. It deals damage as a low-quality club of the same
           mass. Blunt weapons may be manufactured ad hoc from
           items laying around, i.e. rolling-pins, chair-legs, lead-pipe.

           levels in both skills (cheaper, but less flexible). A martial
           artist may purchase many different combinations of Kung
           Fu, as suits him. If the martial artist choose a

           attack that you do not know about (such as a sneak attack or
           being shot at from a long distance). You can give yourself a
           bonus to your Dodge roll by jumping behind cover. If you dodge
           by throwing yourself to the ground or behind partial cover you
           get +1 die. Dodging behind any full cover that may be present
           gives +2 dice.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Improved Anticipated Dodge}
\ruledesc{  This skill
           requires Anticipated Dodge. This is a defensive
           maneuver that is similar to Anticipated Dodge. The
           martial artist spends two actions during his turn to prepare
           his defense and an attack. When attacked, the martial artist
           automatically dodges the attack and performs his own
           counter-attack that may not be defended against. This skill
           works exactly like Anticipated Dodge, except that you
           must spend two actions to prepare instead of one. If the
           declared opponent attacks you before your next turn then you
           may automatically Dodge the attack with no skill roll
           needed. As well, you may make a counter-attack of your choice.
           You must roll normally to determine if you succeed in your
           counter-attack, however your opponent may not defend against
           it. Your counter attack can be any ability that you know
           provided that it can be performed in one action or less and
           that it requires no special preparation. For example, to
           counter-attack with your sword, you must already have had your
           sword drawn beforehand. To counter-attack with a magic spell,
           it must be one that you can cast in 1 action, etc. You may
           counter attack with a modified attack or a special attack, but
           only if you can perform the attack in one action.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Preemptive Block}
\ruledesc{  The
           Martial Artist sees an incoming melee attack and actively
           strikes at his opponent during his opponent's attack.
           This reduces the damage dealt by his opponent.
           Preemptive Block is your defensive maneuver. Roll
           Preemptive Block and also roll to strike with any melee
           attack that you could readily make. If you succeed on both of
           your rolls, then you take only half damage from the incoming
           attack. (There is no need to contest rolls with the attacker).
           However, if you fail either roll then you take full damage.
           Preemptive Block may not be used against ranged or
           missile attacks. Preemptive Block does not deal damage
           to your opponent.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Ranging}
\ruledesc{ You wait for your
           opponent to strike, and then keep your range. During your
           turn, you may reserve level actions for your Ranging maneuver.
           You may not use these actions during your normal turn. If you
           are attacked before your next turn, you may use your range
           skill once for each action you have reserved. When you do so,
           you gain an automatic 5-foot step in any direction. If this
           would place you out of range of your opponent, your opponent
           automatically misses. You may make a single weapon strike
           after your movement, but only if that strike is in range.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Reciprocal Attack}
\ruledesc{ This skill is used
           instead of defending against a melee attack. The martial
           artist allows the incoming attack to strike him as though he
           was not defending at all (and takes full damage from it). Then
           roll Reciprocal Attack. If you succeed, you then make a
           surprise counter-attack in place of your defense. The original
           attacker does not get to roll defense versus the reciprocal
           attack. The reciprocal attack can be any singular ability the
           character knows, so long as it can be performed in 1 action or
           less and the martial artist has the requisite weapon drawn and
           ready for use. If you fail your roll of Reciprocal Attack,
           then your counter-attack misses.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Shield}
\ruledesc{ Shield is used to
           parry. You must EQUAL the opponents strike successes.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Shrug Blow}
\ruledesc{ You trust in the
           toughness of your body to shrug off minor blows in combat.
           This is a defensive maneuver. You allow the blow to hit you.
           Roll BLD with a negative equal to the amount of damage
           sustained from the attack (after considering armor). If you
           succeed in your roll, then you take only 1 damage. If you fail
           in your roll, then you suffer normal damage and loose your
           next action (even if your armor absorbed all the damage). This
           skill is only effective versus standard attacks that deal P,
           S, or C damage. It has no effect versus U attacks.}\vspace{1ex}

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{Name}
\ruledesc{Description thereof.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Aimed Shot}
\ruledesc{  You take
           extra time to carefully align your target in your sights
           before attacking with a ranged weapon. This skill only works
           with ranged weapons, such as a bow, crossbow, or rifle. You
           may take up to LVL consecutive actions to aim at your target.
           These actions must be spent doing nothing other than aiming.
           Each action spent aiming gives you +1 on your strike roll. You
           must be able to clearly see your target in order to aim. If
           you are interrupted during the aiming process then the bonus
           is lost and you must start over.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Bash}
\ruledesc{ You use brute
           force to overwhelm your opponent. Bash takes one action to
           prepare for. It must be used with a melee attack. Roll to
           strike as normal. Add 3*LVL AP to the attack.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Burst}
\ruledesc{ You fire a fully
           automatic weapon, such as a machine gun, at one specific
           target. When firing a burst, the attacker rolls his strike
           roll with a -3 penalty. The target may defend as normal. If
           the target does not defend successfully, then it is struck
           with a number of bullets equal to \ensuremath{1}\textscbf{d}\ensuremath{4}\ensuremath{}[ LVL] OR the burst
           rating of the gun, whichever is lower. Damage is rolled
           separately for each bullet. Firing a burst takes two actions
           and uses BR number of bullets. However, a character may
           continue a burst from an immediately prior action, against the
           same target, for one action. When the character stops firing a
           fully automatic weapon he must spend one action to recover
           before a different target can be fired upon.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Called Shot}
\ruledesc{ Subtract LVL from
           a called shot negative. This cannot make the negative
           positive.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Deadly}
\ruledesc{ You attempt
           to cause an especially lethal wound. You must have knowledge
           of the targets physiology (which may take a roll at the GMs
           discretion). This has no effect versus incorporal, amorphous,
           undead, etc. targets. It is likewise ineffective against
           exotic creatures. This can be used against cyborgs and robots,
           given that you make the applicable roll. Your attack deals
           \$1/2\$ damage, but it is now Undefined. If the target loses
           more than \$1/4\$ of their Hitpoint total in a single strike,
           they must make a BLD check, or fall to 0 HP instantly.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Double Tap}
\ruledesc{ You are skilled at
           attacking the same target rapidly with a ranged weapon. Fire
           an additional LVL shots per action with a negative equal to
           2*LVL to the total number of shots. Failing the double tap
           means all the ammunition is spent and no shots hit.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Drawing Cut}
\ruledesc{ You attack your
           target with a slashing weapon. You attempt to deal extra
           damage by pulling the weapon along the cut. Declare drawing
           cut before your attack, which must be made with a S type melee
           weapon. Roll to strike normally. If you deal damage to your
           opponent, then you automatically deal damage a second time
           (roll again). Your opponent does not get to defend against the
           second damage roll, though any armor he is wearing (or
           supernatural damage reduction) is counted as normal. If you
           miss your strike roll or if you fail to deal damage for
           whatever reason then this skill has no effect and you loose
           your next action.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Feint}
\ruledesc{ You attempt to
           trick your opponent into defending at the wrong time, thereby
           enabling you a better chance at striking. If the Feint roll
           fails, then you must expend an extra attack, but this attack
           proceeds normally. If Feint succeeds, then roll to strike as
           normal. The defender must roll his defensive roll twice, and
           use the worse of the two rolls.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Hold}
\ruledesc{ When a skill or
           modifer causes the character to automatically lose the grapple
           (or similar wording)), the character may roll hold if she
           desires to maintain the hold. In cases where this would modify
           a distance, distance is calculated as if normal, ignoring the
           fact that the target remains held. If the object or limb being
           grappled is removed, hold always fails.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Lunge}
\ruledesc{ On a successful
           lunge you may move and attack in the same action, as long as
           the move is in a straight line and is unobstructed. If you
           fail your lunge, the next action is also used and you make
           your strike rolls at a negative equal to the number of feet
           moved.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Multi-Weapon Style}
\ruledesc{ 
           Multi-Weapon Style has Rank 3*X, where X is the number
           of additional weapons the martial artist intends to
           use. The martial artist can now use more than one
           weapongiven that they are `in-hand'
           (or foot, tentacle etc.)in a single action. Note that
           the additional attacks have the appropriate multi-weapon
           minus; which can be mitigated by using Ambidexterity.
	    
  

\quotexample[Jesse `Capoeira': Double-Kick
           \& Double-Punch]{
    {  
    Jesse wants to perform a Capoeira-style
           Double-Kick followed by a Double-Punch. He purchases
           Multi-Weapon Style for 3 additional weapons; the Rank
           of the Multi-Weapon Style is then 3*3=9
		Since
           it's so expensive, he only purchases one level, so he can
           only use it once per turn. On top of this he has purchases 3
           levels of Ambidexterity, offset all of his multi-use
           strikes by +3. This means when he attacks, in one
           action he can perform two kicks and two punches, if he does
           so his first punch is at -0 to strike, his second punch at -3,
           his first kick at -6, and his second kick at -9. He can do all
           of these strikes as if it were one action without.
           The strikes are considered separate, and pass-or-fail on their
           own.
    }
  }
  

  
	    
    {  
    Note that because Multi-Weapon Style is a
           Modifier, it may not be modified by Basic
           attacks.
    }
  }\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Multitarget}
\ruledesc{ You are skilled at
           making multiple attacks quickly. This enables you to fight
           multiple opponents simultaneously or strike the same opponent
           repeatedly in one action. Multitarget allows the martial
           artist to attack multiple targets in a single combat action.
           The martial artist may choose to target up to LVL+1 targets.
           These may be different opponents or they may be multiple
           attacks against the same opponent. Divide your to-strike dice
           among the selected targets and proceed normally. Damage is
           rolled separately and normally for each target. Your attacks
           must be the same, and they must be a standard melee attack.
           Your target(s) may attempt to defend against each attack
           seperatley. For example, if the martial artist has LVL 5 Punch
           and LVL 2 Multitarget then she may target up to three targets
           with multitarget using a total of 5 dice to strike. For
           example}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Pin}
\ruledesc{ If the character
           successfully deals damage with a P (piercing) weapon, then the
           opponent must roll a BLD check with a negative equal to the
           number of successes the character rolled for her Pin skill. If
           the opponent fails, she is pinned to another surface with that
           weapon, given that the weapon did enough damage to penetrate
           that surface. Pin is only effective if the penetrating weapon
           remains embedded in the target and the pinning surface. For
           example, pin is effective with a spear, but not with a bullet
           even though they both deal P damage.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Point Blank Combat}
\ruledesc{ For each level of
           Point Blank Combat, you may reduce the minimum range of your
           attacks by 5 feet.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Rain Of Blows}
\ruledesc{ Must be declared
           at the beginning of the turn. For each action during the
           declared turn, take LVL plus 1 actions instead. The character
           may only make unmodified attacks during this turn. For the
           next minute the character is at 1 actionturn and -3 to
           all skill rolls. This may only be used LVL2 (round up)
           times per day.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Savage}
\ruledesc{ Savage allows you
           to maximize the damage dealt by an attack, for example}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Shield Binding}
\ruledesc{ When you make a
           successful attack with a Shield Binding attack, you deal no
           damage with that attack, but your opponent may not use an
           equipped shield to defend against any other attack during that
           action.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Skewer}
\ruledesc{ You stab your
           opponent with a P weapon, then continue to drive the weapon
           forward as far as possible. This functions the same as Drawing
           Cut, but for P weapons (Piercing).}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Slam}
\ruledesc{ Slam describes
           various blows such as tackles, body blows, or
           buttinggoring (beasts with horns). It deals the same
           damage as the standard HTH damage chart, but the next category
           up. It us usually C damage. If you attempt a Slam attack and
           miss, then you must spend 1 action to recover.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Spray}
\ruledesc{ You fire a fully
           automatic weapon, such as a machine gun, in the general area
           of your target. Your goal is to increase your chances of
           hitting the target at least once. You roll to strike as
           normal, but with a bonus of +LVL, plus the burst rating of the
           firearm being used. The target may defend as normal. If the
           attack is successful, then the target is struck with a number
           of bullets equal to one-third of the burst rating of the gun,
           rounded down. A spray attack takes two actions and uses BR
           number of bullets. However, a character may continue a spray
           from an immediately prior action, against the same target, for
           one action. When the character stops firing a fully automatic
           weapon he must spend one action to recover before a different
           target can be fired upon.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Stunning Blow}
\ruledesc{ The damage (after
           armor is subtracted) is halved. If they fail a WIL roll with a
           negative equal to the damage taken, they fall unconscious.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Trickshot}
\ruledesc{ You make a ranged
           attack in such a way that you can strike your target in
           difficult situations. Trickshot is used with a ranged attack.
           For each level in trickshot, reduce the strike penalty for
           cover or moving target by 1. This ability cannot provide a
           bonus to strike, it can only reduce penalties that may be
           present. If your level of Trickshot is higher than your strike
           penalty, then the penalty is completely negated.}\vspace{1ex}

           For example, suppose you have LVL 1 fiendish maneuver and LVL
           3 Small Swords. You are fighting an armored knight. You make
           an attack and roll 2 dice to strike (saving one to-strike
           die). As well, you subtract 1 from your damage roll for that

           the weapon that you choose to Hurl, and you do not get a STR
           bonus to damage. However, strike penalties from MSR do still
           apply. The maximum thrown range is 50(encumbrance 1)
           feet. This is considered a missile attack for the purposes of
           defense. When you use hurl you throw the weapon and let go of

\section{Mecha Suits \& Powered Armor}
    
    {  
      A robot in which the pilot is completely protected by
             armor and other mechanisms.Mecha are controlled by abstract
             means and requires the Mecha Piloting skill. 
    }
  
    {  
      Mecha denotes armored mechanical vehicles that are
             built in the form of a human. There are two basic types of
             mecha: Power Armor and Mecha. 
    }
  
    {  
      Power Armor is an armored suit that is
             `worn' like clothing. It provides armor
             protection, but it has the function of increasing the
             wearer's strength, endurance, and weapon payload. It
             is easy to use. The internal computers, etc, in the suit
             allow it to follow the wearer's movements. 
    }
  
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item  Power Armor does NOT require any skill to use
               
  \item  Power Armor must be either the same size as the
               wearer, or exactly one level larger 
\end{itemize}
  
    {  
      True Mecha is best thought of as a vehicle, like an
             airplane or tank, which is often bipedal. Mecha is piloted,
             not worn like power armor. A mecha has a cockpit, and is
             controlled with levers, switches, and pedals. Piloting a
             mecha is something like flying an airplane or driving a car.
             
    }
  
\begin{itemize}
      
  \item  The Mecha Piloting skill is required to operate a
               mecha 
  \item  When piloting a mech, any skill you use is capped at
               your level of mecha piloting. So, if you had LVL 5 Dodge,
               but have a Mecha Piloting skill of 4, you would roll 4
               dice to dodge in your mech. 
  \item  Mecha must be AT LEAST one size level larger than
               the pilot. Beyond that, they can be ANY size. 
\end{itemize}
  
    {  
      As a general summary: Power Armor tends to be a
             lighter and smaller than mecha. Power Armor can carry less
             weaponry (and other hardware), but is usually more
             manueverable. It is often possible to perform major feats of
             dexterity while wearing power armor. This is because the
             power armor does not hinder the wearer's natural
             skills. As well, power armor is easier to use because the
             Mecha Piloting skill is not required. 
    }
  
    {  
      Mecha tend to be larger and more powerful than power
             armor. Mecha generally have more and heavier weapons, better
             armor, and superior auxiliary systems compared to powered
             armor. However, the pilot needs to be skilled to maximize
             the potential of a mecha.

      The number of HP and Slots that a mecha has can
                   be further altered by the internal frame's style
                   and material makup. Frame Style determines the
                   efficiency of how bulky the internal frame of the
                   mecha is, this adjusts the number of slots that are
                   within the mecha. Frame Material is the makeup of the
                   frame, what it is made of. Different materials offer
                   decreased or added hit points to the mecha. Choose the
                   type of Frame Style, as well as the Material. Cross
                   reference them on the chart below, and multiply the
                   number by the size of the mecha to get the CP cost for

      For example, if you chose a `Light Matrix
                   Composite' frame for a size 4 mecha, it will
                   receive -10\% to it's slot total, would gain +60\%

      Various parts of a mecha or powered suit
                   require power to operate. This can come from any
                   number of different sources. A mecha will generally
                   have an ENGINE of some sort that supplies power for
                   moving around, and operating equipment \& weapons.
                   Some mecha will have supplimentary power sources used
                   for especially power-hungry equipment. All power
                   sources take up slots within the suit based on the
                   amount of power that it produces. The more expensive
                   (in CP) a power system is, the more power can be
                   gotten from one slot's worth of the power
                   source. Power is measured in PCs (or Power Cells). All
                   power sources produce the number of listed PC at the
                   beginning of each of the character's turns. All
                   systems on a suit will draw power from this, and if
                   there isn't enough power available, that piece
                   of equipment will not function. So it is vital that
                   the suit has adequate power.

\section{Building a Monster}
    
    {  
     Because of the wide variety of monstrous creatures
             available in literature and fantasy, it is a somewhat futile
             task to attempt to construct an exhaustive list. In
             addition, most GameMasters find that while any particular
             monster is okay, the specific monster they are envisioning
             is not available to them. The Monster section is thus
             divided into three parts: 
    }

\subsection{Base Types}
    
    {  
     The base-types are the fundamental
               `type' or `look' of the monster,
               they are: 
    }
  
\begin{description}
    
  \item[Anthropoid] 
    {  
    Essentially symmetric,
                 bipedal, a head (and possible tail) etc.; a human-like
                 monster 
    }
  
  \item[Bipedal] 
    {  
     covers non-anthropoid
                 bipedal monsters, e.g. Duck, Chipmunk, Wyvern (two legs,
                 two wings) 
    }
  
  \item[Quadruped] 
    {  
    typical of regular
                 animals (mammals), e.g. Dog, Dragon (two legs, two arms,
                 two wings) 
    }
  
  \item[Serpent] 
    {  
     tubes, e.g. Snail
    }
  
  \item[Polymelic] 
    {  
    monsters with many legs
                 or many arms, e.g. Angelus Guhendrian (torus with twelve
                 wings, and an eyeball)
    }
  
  \item[Amorphous] 
    {  
    blobs, pools, puddles,
                 whiffs-of-smoke 
    }
  
\end{description}
  
    {  
     When constructing a monster, the base-type must be
               chosen. Based on the base-type, the size of the creature
               is chosen. The table below lists the fundamental physical
               attributes of the various base-types.

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Allip}
\ruledesc{ Properly speaking,
           an Allip is a special kind of Undead or Spirit. An Allip is
           born whenever a person is deeply wronged by some tragic act
           and is thereby driven to madness and suicide. The body dies
           while the person's soul continues to live as a ghostly
           being. An Allip has the attributes of whatever the human had
           before his suicide. They are truly insane and are driven by
           madness and the overwhelming desire for revenge. The only
           desire of an Allip is to avenge itself by tormenting the
           person or persons responsible for his suicide. When the
           person(s) responisible die, an Allip vanishes into nothing.
           Moving requires intense concentation, and therefore an Allip
           cannot move very quickly.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Babau}
\ruledesc{ Appearance: A
           babau is a constructed creature, similar to a golem. As such
           they vary in exact appearance. However, all babaus resemble
           some other creature from which they are mademost
           commonly an infant of any humanoid racethough they
           could be made from any living creature. A babau looks like the
           creature that it was made from, with the following features:
           they are always naked and carry no equipment or weapons, they
           are perfectly pitch black, and their body lacks much of the
           detail of the original creaturemost delicate or "sharp"
           features are smoothed over. Babaus have no eyes or ears or
           toesthey have only the tinest of bumps where these
           features once were. Their fingers are small nubs, and their
           mouth is a tiny wrinkle. Habits: Babaus are constructs and as
           such, they do whatever their creator has "programmed" them do
           to. The programming of a Babau is set during their creation,
           and typically includes such activities as guarding a certain
           area or performing menial labor. Becasue the complexity of a
           babau's programming is directly related to the learning
           ability of the original creature, the most common babau is
           made from an infant or young child of an intelligent race
           (such as human). If a babau is made from an animal, it is only
           suitable for the most basic of menial tasks. Combat: Babaus
           can be effective combatants due to their impressive strength,
           resiliance, and unique attacks. However, their combat strategy
           is preprogrammed, and such they never deviate in their
           behavior. This behavior is set by their programming, and thus
           it varies depending on their programmer's wishes.
           Generally their attack strategy is to strike and grapple an
           opponent using their limb-tentacles. Once they have secured a
           grapple, they use their energy drain attack as often as
           possible. They typically are programmed to flee and regenerate
           if they are seriously wounded. If a Babau is hit by a slashing
           weapon that deals more than 5 damage, the babau splits into
           two halves. Each is the size of the original babau. One half
           sustains whatever damage was dealt by the blow. The other one
           has full HP. Example: Eric attacks a Babau with a short sword,
           and rolls 14 damage. After deducting the Babau's natural
           armor, the damage sustained is 9 S. Since this is more than 5
           damage, the Babau splits in two. One half sustains that 9
           damage. The other half is at full HP.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Basilisk}
\ruledesc{ A basilisk is a
           large lizard-like creature that is about ten feet long when
           fully grown. It has a stout, thick body and a short, heavy
           tail. It weighs about 400 pounds. The creature has six
           powerful legs and a large head with strong jaws. Basilisks eat
           just about anything, including stone. The basilisk is covered
           with armored scales that are colored similar to it's
           habitat. Woodland basilisks are green, scrubland basilisks are
           a dull brown, etc. The Basilisk's scales are slick with
           poison, and a Basilisk's gaze can turn a living target to
           stone, instantly. Basilisks are of high animal intellience
           (predator) and are totally fearless. A basilisk is unafraid of
           death, and cannot be awed or surprised. They are solitary
           animals and fairly rare. They have a long life span.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Bugbear}
\ruledesc{ Bugbears are
           humanoid creatures that are covered with coarse brown hair.
           They have dog-like ears and flattened noses, and otherwise
           appear human-like. They tend to be stronger and tougher than
           the average human (higher STR and BLD), but they are less
           intelligent (8 INT and WIS is common). They have a simple
           tribal society. They are capable of making tools and act much
           like primitive humans. They will often be found farming or
           hunting animals with simple weapons.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Cave Droll}
\ruledesc{ Apperance: The
           Cave Droll is a small reptile with a bulbous, bean-shaped
           body. Its body is approximatley one foot long and is
           reminiscent of a fat, bloated, sack. It has two spindly
           forelimbs that have 3-fingered hands and opposeable thumbs.
           Its legs are narrow but are much more muscled than the
           forelimbs and have 3-toed feet. Both the fingers and toes
           feature sharp claws. The body is completely covered with
           scales; those on the back are keeled and are quite hard.
           Coloration is chiefly a dark olive green, with streaks of
           brown and other earth tones throughout. The sexes are
           different in appearance: Males have a bright orange or yellow
           patch on the throat area, directly below a large mouth lined
           with sharp teeth. The male's knees are capped with large
           horny spikes. Females lack the colored throat patch and the
           knee spikes. Their mouths are considerably smaller and have
           far smaller teeth. Habits: Cave Drolls are omnivorous
           predators. They lair in secluded areas, most commonly caves,
           but any dark location with shelter from the elements will do.
           Cave Drolls will eat any kind of animal or insect they can
           subdue and kill, and are also known to eat sweet fruits or
           berries when they can find them. Hunting tactics generally
           involve subduing prey with brute force. While Cave Drolls are
           not active man-hunters, they have been known to kill and eat
           humans that stray too near their lairs. Combat: The
           animalistic intelligence of Cave Drolls prevents them from
           utilizing strategy. They are not subtle combatants and have no
           concept of trickery or prioritizing targets. However, their
           hunting instincts are strong, and they are known to hide
           motionless while prey approaches, suddenly making an ambush
           attack to kill it. Individuals simply grab and devour small
           prey, such as rodents or lizards. Larger animals are swarmed
           and attacked en masse: Males attack prey by first jumping at
           it and latching on with their claws. Then, they repeatedly
           pummel it with repeated blows from their spiked knees, and
           deliver their poison bite. Females keep their distance from
           prey, surround it, and spit poison globs.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Cave Horror}
\ruledesc{ Apperance: The
           Cave Horror, also known as the "Great Eatler", resembles an
           enormous beetle. The body is approximatley four feet long,
           three feet wide, and two feet thick. It is covered in a hard,
           shiny, black carapace. Its head is the size of a basketball
           and has two large compound eyes and large, sickle-like
           manibles as prominent features. The creature has four legs,
           each of which is nearly twenty feet long fully extended, but
           are usually carried in a peaked arrangement with the feet
           close to the body. Each foot is tipped with two wicked claws.
           It's appear slender and delicate, but the chitonous
           covering is extremely hard. It's limbs have the strength
           of iron bars. Habits: Though it appears to be a gigantic
           insect, the Great Eatler is actually a hateful monster. It is
           cunning, patient, and greedy to the extreme. Cave Horrors
           build their lairs deep in caves or similar areas, keeping well
           hidden from likely disturbance. When the mood suits
           itfrequentlyor when disturbed, the beast awakes
           and looks for potential prey. The Cave Horror uses its
           exceptional perception skills to track and locate its chosen
           target. It observes its target(s) for some time, before
           deciding when and how to attack. It often times strikes from
           the darkness or hiding (often on the celing), surging forth to
           attack the victim and then retreating to plan a future attack.
           Cave Horrors do not covet treasure specifically, but generally
           accumulate it due to their long lifespan and propensity to
           attack sentient prey. Combat: The Cave Horror is an
           intelligent combatant. It follows and observes targets before
           beginning combat with a suprise attack. It may make use of
           ambushes or tricks in order to gain the upper handor
           simply to confuse, distract, or block of its prey's
           escape route. When actually fighting the Cave Horror relies on
           its claw attacks and its bite.}\vspace{1ex}

           a Lion, and the back half is that of a goat. It has three
           heads: a goat, lion, and a serpent. It has a tail with bony
           spikes along it's length. It has a pair of bat-like wings
           atop its back. Each head can function indipentantly of the

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Cockatrice}
\ruledesc{ A cockatrice is a
           grotesque bird-like creature that is about the size of a
           turkey. It is covered with tough, warty skin and it also has
           scales on some parts of it's body. Cockatrices eat only
           stone, and are found in groups of 6-10. They aren't
           particularly intelligent and spend their time looking for food
           (things to turn to stone and then eat) and sleeping.
           Cockatrices, like the Basilisk, have the ability to turn a
           target to stone with just a gaze. The bite of a cockatrice can
           also turn a target to stone.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Deviruchi}
\ruledesc{ Apperance: A small
           daemon standing approximatley 18" in height. The body is round
           and plump, resembling a pillow. Coloration is almost entirely
           black; some specimens exhibit faint red spots or a red stripe
           along the back. Two tiny bat-wings grow from its back, but
           they are too small to be used for flight. Its arms are small,
           and usually carry an iron pitchfork approximatley 24" in
           length. They usually do not speak, but are known for
           chattering in an excited manner when fighting or tormenting
           the wounded. Habits: Deviruchi are among the lowliest of
           daemons. As such, they are not particularly intelligent,
           though they are intensely curious and of the same mental
           capacity as a child. As they are physically and intellectually
           weak, their masters rarely attempt to give them significant
           responsibilities; rather they are simply dispersed in the
           world, spreading havoc and furthering all manner of evil.
           Deviruchi may therefore be found in nearly any location or
           climate, so long as humans or innocent beasts are present to
           torment. Combat: Deviruchi are small, fast-moving, and have
           numerous offensive capabilites. They are fairly dangerous
           1-on-1, but are especially dangerous in groups. When a group
           of Deviruchi is encountered, all individuals generally swarm
           and attack the same opponent. However, they are easily
           distracted and may quickly shift from one opponent to the next
           for seemingly no reason. They rarely fight with any sort of
           organized strategy, however all Deviruchi relish combat and
           enjoy inflicting pain and suffering on any living thing. They
           are unlikely to run from a fight, though they do scatter and
           regroup when overwhelmed.}\vspace{1ex}


    


\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Dirge Worm}
\ruledesc{ Apperance: The
           dirge worm is a revolting and horrific monster which is
           constantly surrounded with the stench of decaying flesh. The
           creature's body resembles a bloated grub or worm, except
           it is twenty-five feet long and two feet in diameter. Its skin
           is a tough, transparent membrane which is coated in a
           yellowish slime. The skin is stretched tight around the
           creature's body, making it look like it might burst at
           any moment. The combination of the slime and the transparent
           skin makes a dirge worm appear to be a writhing tube of
           mutilated fleshwhen in fact it is a living creature. A
           Dirge Worm's head resembles a grotesquely oversized human
           head. It has no hair and is covered with the same transparent
           skin and slime of the body. The forehead is extended, the
           mouth exaggerated, and it has tiny black eyes. The creature
           has no lips, and thus its mouthfull of jagged
           teethis clearly visible. Dirge worms move like a snake
           and are capable of extreme speed. Habits: Dirge worms live
           underground. They lair in caves, old dungeons, sewers,
           abandoned mineshafts, and similar locationsanywhere
           damp and dark with sufficient space to accomodate their size.
           Dirge worms eat dead, decaying flesh. To this end they attack
           large prey. They often lair near humanoid settlements, from
           which they raid livestock and people alike. They haul the dead
           back to their lair and leave the bodies to rot. Once the flesh
           is sufficienly putrid, the creature consumes it. Dirge worms
           are fond of eating minor undead, such as zombies, as they are
           "instant" sources of dead, decayed flesh. They are also
           attracted to graveyards, burial pits, or battlefields where
           they collect great quantities of corpses to feed their
           insatiable hunger. Dirge Worm slime is valued by Necromancers
           for use in fell ritals. Thus some powerful necromancers seek
           out dirge worms and even supply them with zombies and other
           hapless victims in order to have a source of slime readily
           available. Though they are powerful, Dirge Worms prefer not to
           fight directly. They use their abilities to hide and move in
           darkness to suprise and overwhelm prey. Combat: When "hunting"
           prey, the dirge worm waits for its target to pass close by. It
           then bursts forth from the ground or from a hiding spot in a
           nearby marshy area, to attack. Usually one bite is sufficent
           to kill a potential victim. If facing multiple targets it uses
           its spell-like abilities immedietly to gain an advantage early
           on, then fights with its teeth and stinger.}\vspace{1ex}

           short (4') grey-skinned humanoid with large, slanting,

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Embalmed Master}
\ruledesc{ The Embalmed
           Master was the greatest work of the necromancers Erasmus
           Diggle and Duncan Nusukan. This evil creature represented the
           best of their combined skills in embalming, undead animation,
           dark magic, and artificing. Duncan Nusukan chose the body of
           his enemy, King Asmodius, for this horrible creation.
           Apperance: The Embalmed Master at first glance appears to be a
           large man wearing armor. However, continued observation
           results in the viewer realizing the true nature of this horrid
           creation. Asmodius' body, stripped of its skin, has been
           chemically embalmed and infused with unholy magic, as an
           "embalmed zombie". The creature bears magical tattoos worked
           directly into the muscles, futher empowering it. The armor it
           wears is made of heavy chains, riveted into a suit of chain
           mail of gross proportions. Additional iron chains dangle from
           the armor and drag across the ground like a train of a
           noble's robea horrific mockery of Asmodius'
           former position in life. Habits: Like an Embalmed Zombie, the
           Embalmed Master is the undead servant of it's creator,
           Duncan Nusukan. His default "programming" is to act as
           Nusukan's bodyguard. He must obey Nusukan's every
           whim, and thus may be sent on special missions. Despite being
           under Nusukan's control, the Embalmed Master may "think"
           for himself, and is therefore far more skilled than a simple
           zombie. Combined with his immense strength, he is a powerful
           foe indeed. Combat: The Embalmed Master fights as an expert
           warrior would fight, as he retains his former combat
           experience. However, he is bound to obey any orders issued by
           Nusukan.}\vspace{1ex}

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Freysian Cave Hopper ("Deadly
           Insect")}
\ruledesc{ Apperance: This
           insect resembles an oversized leaf grasshopper, approximatley
           two feet long. It has six legs. The rearmost pair are enlarged
           for jumping while the other four legs are much smaller. Each
           leg ends in a clawed foot. The creature has a chitinous body
           colored a green or brown shade, often similar to that of its
           enviornment. Like a normal grasshopper, the Freysian Cave
           Hopper has wings and can fly (albeit in a clumsy fashion). Its
           inner wings are a bright scarlet red color; these are not
           visible unless the creature is actually flying. In a wooded
           area Freysian Cave Hoppers can be very difficult to see as
           they blend in with the foliage quite effectively. Habits: The
           creature is an omnivourous scavenger: its typical diet is
           mostly plant matter, but it will eat carrion as well as dead
           or decaying plants. It does not sleep, and spends most of its
           time searching for food and potential mates. Fresian Hoppers
           are not agressive and do not hunt live prey. However, they are
           fiercely territorial of their "nest" area. They are usually
           solitary, meeting others of their kind only to mate. Females
           defend their egg sacs but once the young hatch they are left
           to fend for themselves. Combat: Freysian Hoppers do not enter
           combat unless attacked or defending their nest or egg sac.
           When pressed into combat they attempt to frighten intruders by
           making a loud chirping sound (similar to that of a cricket,
           but loud enough to cause temporary deafness) and unfolding
           their red inner wings as a kind of threat display. Their bite
           is weak, though their powerful sting is intensely painful and
           is potent enough to kill a healthy adult if medical assistance

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Giant Slipper Snail}
\ruledesc{ Apperance: This
           strange creature appears to be a pile of rubbish at first
           glance. It is actually a type of pretatory snail. The
           snail's body resembles that of a giant slug, over five
           feet long and about two feet thick. Like a slug, its body is
           rubbery and has no bones, so it can squeeze into various
           shapes. It's shell is shaped like an upside-down shoe.
           The bottom side is halfway covered and is flat, lying close to
           the ground. The upper side of the shell is bean-shaped. The
           creature covers it's shell with various detritus that it
           collects from its enviornment, thereby camoflaugeing itself.
           It keeps its eyestalks well hidden inside the trash covering
           its shell. The creature's "face" features four eye stalks
           and four muscular prehensile tentacles that it uses to eat and
           manipulate objects. It's mouth features a beak similar to
           that of a squid, and a fleshy tubelike proboscis through which
           it can secrete its adhesive or fire its poison dart. Habits:
           The Giant Slipper Snail is a terrestrial ambush predator. It
           hides very effectively after having covered its shell with
           detritus from the area in which it hunts, making it blend into
           the background. It sits motionless for long periods of time
           (days if need be) waiting for potential prey to walk nearby.
           After detecting the approach of potential prey (from vibration
           in the ground) it attacks once the prey is close. The creature
           is extraordinarly stupid and kills only to eat meat. Once any
           prey has been devoured, it scatters the remains about,
           sometimes attaching parts of the victim to it's shell.
           Gaint Slipper Snails eat the entire body of their prey,
           including bones, hair, and teeth, which provide the minerals
           it needs to grow its shell. Combat: Giant Slipper Snails are
           not combative in general, however they are prone to attack
           nearly anything when hungry. A large prey target is attacked
           using its poison dart. The creature then waits for the poison
           to take effect before taking further action. Smaller prey
           animals (rodents, frogs, lizards, and the like) are simply
           grabbed and constricted using its tentacles. If the snail
           encounters a tough prey animal, it simply retreats inside
           it's armored shell and uses it's adhesive to stick
           itself to the floor, waiting for the threat to go away.}\vspace{1ex}

           rapidly. Habits: Metal Babbles are of very low intelligence.
           They like dark areas such as old cellars, caves, and

\hspace{-2ex}\rulename{ Rabbat}
\ruledesc{ Apperance: The
           Rabbat is frightening beast to behold. It consists of a
           bulbous central body which is dominated by a single giant
           eyeball and a huge mouth filled with vicious looking
           teethleaving no doubt that this beast is a meat eater.
           Two bat-like wings extend from the central body. It has no
           other limbs. Habits: Rabbats are aggressive meat eaters. In
           the wild, they persue and attack anything they think they can
           kill, which is most creatures. Rabbats are only afraid of very
           large, powerful, beasts such as Dragons. They may be found in
           nearly any enviornment, but they tend to lair in caves.
           Rabbats are much more powerful than they are intelligent, and
           thus they are sometimes subjugated by powerful wizards for use
           as minions. Combat: Rabbats are unsubtle and make no use of
           trickery or deciet. They do, however, know the tactical
           advantage of staying away from a fight and utilize their
           ranged spell-like abilities, closing in to bite only when they
           are clearly winning the fight. They are unlikely to flee

           a Trait. They do not need to buy Magical
           Control, Spellcasting, Faith, Mysticism,
           etc. The rank of the specific Trait is the rank of the
           spell. For purposes of control (striking, LVL, etc.), the
           level at which the Spell Ability has been purchased is
           used for these calculations. The cost of using the ability is
           the same Mana Point cost as the spell itself.

           level 4, Flame Shroud at level 1, Living Fire at
           level 1, and Flame Whip at level 2. Although he feels
           it was unnecessary, his secret master has been forcing him to
           train in the `mystic arts' to learn to
           control his powers better (Mysticism, level 3).
           Although he thinks it's bunk, and wasn't necessary,
           he can certainly use his powers longer nowadays.

           for Flame Whip, Fire Shards, and
