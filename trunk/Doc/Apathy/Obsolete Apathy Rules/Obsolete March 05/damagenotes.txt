 Damage Notes

In Apathy, the general rule for hit points and damage can be simply stated: if something reaches zero hit points, it is incapacitated, and falls unconscious; if something reaches negative maximum hit points, it is dead.  (also, remember that if the victim makes a WIL check, they can stay conscious below 0 HP)  This rule was adopted because it is simple to implement, and is well-defined—eliminating confusion and making gameplay simple and fast.  However, it is NOT realistic.  We recommend that players and GMs alike study this discussion and apply it to their gameplay, as it will result in greatly improved realism.

1. Not all damage is the same.  As any experienced hunter knows, location of damage is very important.  There are well documented cases of situations in which people have shot an elephant, bear, or other large animal literally dozens of times with large-caliber rifles and have done little except anger the creature.  Likewise, skilled hunters with very small guns, or even simple weapons like bows and spears, have routinely killed similar game with one strike, thanks to accuracy.

2. Dead isn’t really dead.  The effects of adrenaline, stress, and drugs on life-or-death situations are not to be underestimated.  A well known, true, story of Henry Poolman, an African hunting guide, goes as follows.  Poolman shot a lion straight through the heart with a .500 caliber big-game rifle at close range.  By anyone’s guess the animal was dead several times over.  The lion collapsed on the ground, unmoving.  When Poolman and his gun bearer got closer, the lion got up and charged them.  Despite Poolman and his guide BOTH shooting the lion several more times with very large caliber weapons, they were unable to stop it and Poolman was torn apart.  It is certain that the lion had suffered a mortal would, but it wasn’t going to die just yet.  Likewise, there are many police reports of criminals on PCP who have taken huge numbers of bullets and barely been slowed down by them.

3. Keep in mind how fast combat flows.  Each action is a second or two.  It is practically impossible to kill something in one second.  Even a pinpoint strike with a deadly weapon may take many seconds or even minutes to be fatal.  Several seconds might not seem like a lot of time, but that’s an entire round of combat!

It would slow down our roleplaying tremendously to consider these factors in each and every combat situation.  However, such things are good to consider for special encounters, etc.  The following rules can be used to assist the GM in determining what happens in such an encounter:

· An animal (or anything with fairly low intelligence) is much more likely to suffer the adrenaline effect and keep attacking even when very seriously damaged.  In these cases, the GM might want to say that the creature always makes it’s willpower roll to stay conscious after dropping below 0 HP.
· Drug users are very likely to demonstrate exceptional resiliency as well.  As above, they might automatically make their WIL check.
· If a creature suffers significant damage to the BRAIN, consider them dead instantly—whether they have suffered full damage or not.  This is the tactic hunters use when shooting massive animals such as elephants.
· Think about the TYPE of damage involved.  If a large creature is suffering only superficial wounds, the GM might want to give bonuses to the WIL check.  Conversely, if the target is suffering critical, D, U, or otherwise “important” damage, the WIL check should NOT get a bonus.
· Damage to organs like the heart, lungs, and liver is certainly life threatening.  However, it is nowhere near instant.  Even if catastrophic damage is dealt, the target might live for thirty seconds or more.  That might not seem like a lot, but keep in mind that a combat round is about TWO seconds, so as far as combat time goes, that is NOT a quick kill.  Targets that will necessarily incapacitate a living target instantly are the brain, brain stem, or upper spinal cord.
