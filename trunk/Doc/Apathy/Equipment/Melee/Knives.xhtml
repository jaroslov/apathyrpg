        <p>A Southeast Asian knife, as carried by the Gurkha regiments of India and Singapore. This is a large knife, nearly the size of a machete. The blade has a strong downward or forward angle. It is nearly useless for stabbing, but is a very effective weapon and chopping tool. A well made kukri is just as effective as a small axe for chopping.</p>

        <p>A special variety of fighting knife. The slender blade is longer than 8&#x201D;, and sharpened along both edges. It is specifically made for combat is and effective for both stabbing and sashing.  This sort of knife has little use as a tool.  It's unusual length and slender blade make it possible to stab a human in the heart via an upward blow underneath the rib cage.</p>

        <p>A knife with a scalloped or otherwise serrated edge. The serrations are very effective for damaging flesh and also for cutting fibrous materials such as rope or cloth, but they reduce the knife's effectiveness at penetrating hard materials.  Knives of this sort are commonly issued as "survival knives" and are also popular tools for miliary use.  The serrated knife is much more useful as a tool than straight-edged knives.</p>
