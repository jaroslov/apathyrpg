        <p> &#x201C;Automatically Loading Cannon&#x201D; An autocannon similar to a modern semiautomatic rifle, but scaled up to an artillery size weapon. Ammunition is stored in a magazine attached to the gun.  The gun uses recoil energy or gas pressure from one shot in order to automatically eject the spent casing and reload the next shell.  This is a simple weapon with a low rate of fire.</p>

A chaingun is a rapid-fire cannon using a single barrel but driven using a chain mechansim and a belt-feeder to generate a higher rate of fire than relying on inertia alone.  A chaingun requires power to operate but provides a high rate of fire in a compact space.</p>

        <p>A Field Gun is a very simple artillery cannon.  The gun has a single barrel and is fairly slow to reload. A tank cannon or artillery piece would be a classic example. Field guns take one action to reload before they can fire again. Reloading may be automated or manual.</p>

        <p>Flechette cannons are specialized chainguns that fire hundreds of sharp metal darts.  Flechettes are highly effective versus un- or lightly-armored and lightly-built targets.  This makes them ideal for anti-infantry use.  Flechette cannon deals (Class+1)D4+(Class/3) S (Slashing) damage, in bursts of <span class="roll"><span class="num">1</span><span class="face">10</span><span class="bns"/></span>. They have 10 AP. Flechette ammunition is 1/10th the size of usual ammunition (thus a pod stores 10x as much ammunition), but costs 5x more.</p>

Individual breeches may be turned on or off at will, allowing the gun to fire at a lower rate in order to conserve ammunition.

        <p>The snub cannon is a devastating short-range cannon which fires shells of unusually heavy weight.  The snub cannon may be fired directly, like a rifle, from point-blank to a range of 100 meters.  Beyond that point the shell droops too far to aim reliably.  The snub cannon may also be fired in a high arc like a mortar with the aid of an Artillery Computer.  Fired in this manner the range is 100-1000 meters and the shells fall straight down on the the target, reaching a very high terminal velocity which adds AP:20 and deals an additional 50% damage.  The snub cannon has a short but very heavy barrel, massive heavyweight shells, and a much more powerful detonant than a normal cannon. Deals (Class+1)/2 (rounded up!) x20 C (Crushing) damage. The mecha may not fire while moving or the next action after firing. Recovery time is 3, reloading must be performed manually.  Reloding requires dextrous limbs and hands, be they human or robotic.</p>
