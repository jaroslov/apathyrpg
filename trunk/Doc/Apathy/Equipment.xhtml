        <p>Most weapons have a single damage type.  For example, a "P" weapon deals Piercing damage.  Some weapons may deal different damage types depending on how the weapon is used.  For example, the Fireman's Axe is P/S.  Striking with the axe blade deals S damage while striking with the spike on the back of the head deals P damage. For damage type listed as X/Y, the weapon can deal either type of damage for a given attack, but not both at the same time. For a P/S weapon, the attcker can choose to do a P or S attack.
        STR Req is the minimum strength required to wield the weapon. For every point of STR under Min. STR, the attack gets -1 damage and -2 to strike/parry. If the MSR is met, for every point of STR over 8 add one point of damage to the raw roll, up to a maximum of the MSB (Max Strength Bonus) A raw bonus is always indicated with square brackets. So <span class="roll"><span class="num">3</span><span class="face">4</span><span class="bOff">+</span><span class="bns">1</span><span class="rOff">+</span><span class="raw">4</span><span class="kind"/></span> would be a normal <span class="roll"><span class="num">3</span><span class="face">4</span><span class="bOff">+</span><span class="bns">1</span></span> roll, with an additional 4 added to the final result. When wielding a 1-H weapon with two hands, assume the wielder has +3 STR.</p>

                    <p>Plasma weapons are a bladeless handle (typically looks like a normal weapon handle or a flashlight) from which a glowing blade of extremely hot plasma vents forth. The plasma is held in the shape of a cylinder (or blade) by a magnetic field. They take an action to turn on.</p>

                    <p>Due to the difference between using a plasma weapon verses normal weapons, they require the Archaic Weapons - Energy skill to use. Anyone can use their normal sword skill (or axe skill respectively) but will get a critical failure on a 4 or below (instead of the normal 1).</p>

                    <p>Plasma weapons cannot be parried by non-plasma weapons, likewise, they cannot parry non-plasma weapons. Similarly, shields cannot block plasma weapons. Plasma weapons can parry other plasma weapons, and force fields protect against them as normal If a plasma weapon comes in contact with another one, there is a 25chance the magnetic fields of the blades will lock together. It is easy to tell if combatants are locked as an extremely bright glow emanates from the contact point of the weapons. Getting out of a lock requires an action where a strength contest ensues. If there is more than a difference of 8 between the two strength rolls, the lock is broken and the loser loses his or her next action. If no break occurs, the combatants must attempt again on the next action. Either combatant in a lock can turn off their weapon, in which case he or she automatically loses the lock challenge, and gets the same negative as if he lost due in a STR contest.</p>

                    <p>One side effect of having a magnetic field around the blade, is that it is possible to parry projectile energy attacks (such as shots from a beam rifle). Doing so the wielder is at a -8.</p>

            <p>Rocket-assisted weapons are modern versions of traditional archaic weapons. They have small rocket motors contained in the weapon. When the weapon is swung, the motor ignites, giving extra force to the blow. They are used with the same skill as normal archaic weapons.</p>
            <p>If such a weapon is used, and the target is missed, then it takes an extra two actions to recover. If the target is hit but the blow is parried or blocked, then it takes the normal time to recover.</p>
            <p>When using rocket assisted weapons, you need an extra success to parry melee attacks. (At least two better than attacker.)</p>
            <p>Each weapon can store up to 5 &#x201C;rocket charges.&#x201D; When these are used up, they must be refilled before the weapon can be used. Each charge costs $100 to refill.</p>

They are no louder than opening a soda can when fired. Damage at ranges less than 30 feet is half of normal. Damage at ranges greater than 60 feet is +2 per die. Accuracy is a -1 to strike, plus a -1 for every 10 feet to the target. These guns have virtually no recoil. Gyrojet carbines are an available option, however, the cost is an additional $500, and teh accuracy is at +1 to strike. They have double the ammunition capacity.</p>

        <p>Most energy weapons are powered by a battery pack. These are interchangable between weapons. Energy within the packs is consumed as the weapon is fired, like normal bullets. They are called &#x201C;batts&#x201D; or &#x201C;b-paks&#x201D; in slang. B-paks store energy in units of EU. Different weapons consume EU at different rates. Smaller weapons use 1 EU per shot. Larger weapons might use more. Pistols can hold ONE pack. Rifles/cannons can usually hold 3. B-paks can be recharged. Recharging a pack takes about thirty seconds per EU that has been used. As a general rule, it costs $1 per EU to have pack recharged. HD paks require special equipment to charge and these cost about $1.50 per EU to charge.</p>

            <p>Basics for Armor and Damage</p>

            <ul class="itemized-list">
              <li>
                <p>Armor has 3 main values: Piercing, slashing, and crushing. Armor values are represented by 3 numbers separated by slashes (represented by: P/S/C; piercing/slashing/crushing). Example: Armor with values of 4/3/7 would have 4 points of protection vs. Piercing, 3 vs. Slashing, and 7 vs. crushing damage.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Armor does not protect from Undefined (U) or Direct (D).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A characters Base Armor is the only thing that can protect vs. U damage. Nothing can protect against D damage.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>All non D/U damage has an associated damage type to is; either P, S, or C. Subtract all matching armor values of the character from the damage being done. If the damage value is still above 0, then the character takes that amount of damage.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A weapon with an armor piercing (AP) attack will list the amount of AP it has. Subtract this AP number from all of the armors damage values when determining its protection against the attack. This cannot drop the armors value below 0.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>GMs determine when armor is damaged beyond use/protection.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Hard Armor is any armor that uses hard ceramic/plastic/metallic/wooden plates or coverage to protect the character. Hard armor is MUCH more durable than non-hard armor. Hard armor is denoted by hard on the armor sheet. Note that the components of hard armor are hard. They cannot be bent without damaging the armor. Hard armor is generally made specifically for the wearer, it will only fit others with nearly identical body proportions.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Soft armor (armor that isnt considered hard) is at least somewhat flexible. It will generally fit anyone of similar size/stature.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Armor with the descriptor fire has fire protection. This means the armor has the natural ability to deflect and protect against fire attacks. The armor will protect from all fire damage (assuming the fire hits the armor, so full suits are better for this).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Armor can be layered, but only one hard suit can be worn at a time. A person can have different hard armors on different parts of the body. Non-hard armors can be layered indefinitely. Add all armor values of the armors together to give the full armor protection. If any armor has fire protection, fire will be stopped, but any armor on top of it is still susceptible to the fire.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A character can wear (without penalty) as much armor in size levels as his Encumbrance score will allow. Add up all layers of armor to get the complete Size level of the armor, if this number is equal or less than Encumbrance, then no negatives are given to the player.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>When a character has more armor than his Encumbrance (ENC) allows, then the player has the following penalties against him:</p>
                <ul class="itemized-list">
                  <li>
                    <p>-2 DEX per pt over ENC</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>-1 action per 2 full points over ENC</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>An armors Class is a general idea of what period of history/future the armor would appear. A later period can find the earlier armor.</p>

                <p>Shields can be used to block splash attacks that are thrown at them. These include fireballs, lightning strikes, breath weapons, chemical splashes, etc. To block one of these attacks, the user must make a block roll at -3.
