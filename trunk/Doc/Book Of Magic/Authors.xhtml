<!--

		The authors section for a book must be a single element called "div" that
		hass an attribute `class' with the value "header". With the header, only
		a single element "div" with the `class' attribute of "authors" is supported.

		Below you can see that you can multiple "author" entries. For example, our
		primary (first) author entry is an image. Including images in a document
		is done through the use of an "img" element.

      <img width="100%" src="Resources/hermesbird.jpg"/>
