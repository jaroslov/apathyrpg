          <text><Apathy/> is a paper <and/> pencil role-playing game. <Apathy/><rsquo/>s authors have played a great many RPGs including D<and/>D, Heroes Unlimited, GURPS, Shadowrun, TMNT, various White Wolf games (Vampire, etc.), Deadlands, and a few others. While these games are all fun, we felt that each game had various shortcomings that could be improved upon. Enter <Apathy/>. <Apathy/> is designed to be a very flexible role-playing system. <Apathy/> can handle classic games with knights and dragons, as well as modern-day, Cyberpunk, superhero, or futuristic scenarios. It excels at fantasy games that blend all genres.</text>
          <text><Apathy/> is recommended for advanced role-players (or at least for experienced DM/GM/Storytellers). This is because the <Apathy/> system is designed for a unique mix of speed and realism rather than carefully <ldquo/>balanced<rdquo/> rules. The <Apathy/> rules make it very easy to make unbalanced (<ldquo/>min-maxed<rdquo/>) or tweaked characters. <Apathy/> is likewise not appropriate for <ldquo/>rules lawyers<rdquo/> or excessively anal GMs and players.</text>
          <text><Apathy/> was created around several core features. These are what make <Apathy/> a unique game system:</text>
          <itemized-list>
            <item>
              <text><Apathy/> has no fixed character classes, such as <ldquo/>fighter<rdquo/> or <ldquo/>wizard<rdquo/>, etc. Players can pick and choose every detail of their character, rather than being forced into set classes.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text><Apathy/> contains rules for all manner of technological and supernatural powers, weapons, items, and skills for characters to use. These range from archaic concepts like martial arts and swords, through ultra-modern concepts such as cybernetics and mecha<mdash/>and the supernatural abilities of magic and psionics. These different elements can be used simultaneously without any one being excessively powerful.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text>There are no discrete <ldquo/>levels<rdquo/> for character advancement. Characters develop and grow constantly, rather than infrequent, sudden, increases common to level-based games. There is a distinct and obvious increase in <ldquo/>power<rdquo/> as characters grow. This gives players the feeling that their characters are constantly improving as the game continues.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text>The game rules are purposely devoid of <ldquo/>fluff<rdquo/> rules. Time-consuming (and therefore not fun) look-up tables and thick books of rules are nowhere to be found. <Apathy/> is designed to be fast to play. Most of the <ldquo/>tables<rdquo/> in the <Apathy/> manuals are just to explain things to the players and aren<rdquo/>t used during play.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text>While <Apathy/> is devoid of many <ldquo/>clutter rules<rdquo/>, it does have an emphasis on realism. <Apathy/><rsquo/>s combat system is an excellent compromise between speed and realism.</text>
            </item>
          </itemized-list>
          <text>In any game of <Apathy/>, the CHARACTERS are the heroes!</text>

                <text><define>Action</define></text>
              </description>
              <text>An action is the most basic unit of time during combat. It is roughly equal to one second of time. Most characters will have three Actions per turn, though certain things can increase or decrease this number. Note that as long as a character is unconscious, he or she always has at least one Action per turn.</text>

              <description>
                <text><define>Base Armor</define></text>
              </description>
              <text>A character<rdquo/>s natural resistance to bodily harm of unusual varieties. You can think of this as <ldquo/>toughness<rdquo/> (not to be confused with the skill of the same name). A character<rdquo/>s base armor reduces the damage they suffer from U (undefined) damage. Base Armor does not protect against any other form of damage, such as P, S, C, or D. Note, that if a character suffers any U damage, no matter how high their Base Armor might be, they always loose at least 1 HP.</text>

                <text>HP</text>
              </description>
              <text>Abbreviation for Hit Points. Hit Points are used to represent a character<rdquo/>s health. If a character gets injured, their HP decreases. If a character reaches 0 HP, they fall unconscious. If a character reaches -X HP, where X is equal to their maximum HP, they are dead. Note that if a character is below 0 HP, they will loose 1 HP per turn (1 HP per 3 seconds when not in combat) due to bleeding, unless they are given medical attention.</text>

              </description>
              <text>Usually, this is short for Luck Points. Luck Points are accumulated during gameplay, and players redeem them for combat bonuses, or for saving their character<rdquo/>s butt if things get rough. This is used to help unlucky die rolls from screwing over players. All major character in the game, including significant NPCs, villains, etc. will have Luck Points. The GM is responsible for distributing Luck Points.</text>

          <title><text>Game World</text></title>
          <text><Apathy/>, like most role-playing games, can be thought of like a play or a movie. The players are like the actors; their characters are the heroes and heroines of the story. Like a movie, a game can take place in any number of settings. The GM is like the director, and decides the intricacies of the game world.</text>
          <text>The GM should talk with the players and decide upon what kind of game world they would like to use. The GM can then finalize the details of that world, and should tell the players about it before the players make their characters and the game starts.</text>
          <text>Some things to think about when creating the game world are the following:</text>
          <numbered-list>
            <item>
              <text>Time Period: Medieval? Modern-day? Futuristic?</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text>Location: on Earth? A different planet? A particular city, perhaps?</text>

            <item>
              <text>Level of technology</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text>Allowed game subsections: Magic? Psionics? Supernatural Powers? etc.</text>
            </item>
          </numbered-list>
          <text>The <Apathy/> system contains sections for many different types of games and many different historical settings. The GM should decide which ones to allow for each game.</text>
        </section>
        <section kind="section">
          <title><text>Creating a Character</text></title>
          <text>The first step in playing <Apathy/> is determining your character concept. Talk to the GM and your fellow players for ideas about the game setting and what kind of character you might want to play. Your imagination is the only real limit as to what your character can be. Perhaps you want to play a heroic knight that fights for honor and puts monsters to the sword? Or maybe you<rdquo/>d rather play a cunning and seductive thief with a hidden agenda. You could be a young mecha pilot<mdash/>inexperienced, but eager to fight for his cause. Your character is a hero in the game. You should take this opportunity to have fun and do things you can<rdquo/>t do in real life.</text>
          <text>If you are having trouble thinking up a character concept, you might want to look to books, movies, or even historical precedent as to what kind of character you want to play. You could be a space mercenary like Han Solo from Star Wars, or maybe a secret agent like James Bond<mdash/>or perhaps an old-west gunslinger.</text>
          <text>Once you have an idea so to what kind of character you want to play, it<rdquo/>s time to develop that idea. Think about what your character looks like. How old are they? How do they dress? What kinds of possessions do they have? What do they do for a living? What was their past? How would they react in a fight? What would they do if they were suddenly given a lot of money? What are their fears? Their hopes? Their goals?</text>
          <text>Now you should have a good understanding of your character<rdquo/>s appearance, personality, skills, etc. What you need to do next is represent that idea in the <Apathy/> system rules. Grab a character sheet, and follow along.</text>
          <section kind="section">
            <title><text>Character Basics</text></title>
            <text>The first part of describing your character is very simple. Decide what your character<rdquo/>s basic description is like. Are they male or female? How tall? What do they weigh? Fill in age, sex, height, weight, eyes color, and hair color/style on the upper right portion of your character sheet. Decide on your character<rdquo/>s name, and fill that in too. There is also a spot on the character sheet for your name. Now you can move on to the details of your character.</text>
          </section>
          <section kind="section">
            <title><text>Attributes</text></title>
            <text> <Apathy/> models characters by means of a core attribute system. These attributes are numbers that describe the most basic characteristics of any given character. They are:</text>

              <text>Throughout this document the attributes will usually be mentioned using the three-letter abbreviation instead of the full name.</text>
            </note>
            <text>The first three attributes (STR, DEX, and BLD) are considered Physical Attributes. The second three attributes (INT, WIS, and WIL) are Mental Attributes. The seventh, CHA, is a little of both, but is generally considered to be a Mental Attribute.</text>
            <text>Attributes are rated on a scale. 1 is the lowest possible attribute score. There is no top end on the scale, though an attribute of 20 is the peak of human ability. A human character can never have an attribute higher than 20 without some supernatural effect (super power, magic, cybernetics, etc).</text>
            <text>When creating a character, the GM allows you a certain number of attribute points. Attribute Points are used to purchase the attribute values you want your character to have. A normal human has about 40 attribute points. An above average human would have about 105<ndash/>140 attribute points. We recommend that 120 Attribute Points be assigned to starting characters<mdash/>after all, player characters are supposed to be heroic<mdash/>though the GM has the final word.</text>
            <text>The cost of an attribute is computed like a skill with Rank 1 (see the skill section later on). However, the final value for the attribute (for a Human) is increased by 8; that is, if you buy 5 levels of STR (for 15 AP), then the final value of the STR is<math  xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>13</mn></mrow></math>.</text>
            <note>
              <text>In most cases no player may have an attribute below 8. Attributes below 8 are considered handicapped and/or disabled, and such a character would probably not be adventuring!</text>
            </note>
            <note>
              <text>If the GM deems it OK, then you may reduce an attribute below 8, but you get NO benefits (you wouldn<rdquo/>t get points in another attribute for example). Why would you do this? Simple, it<rdquo/>s in your character concept. Would a 6-year-old child have an 8 STR? Not likely.</text>
            </note>
            <text>When recording your attributes on the character sheet, record the number of Attribute Points you spent on that attribute, this will help you when you wish to increase them later.</text>
            <note>
              <text>No attribute can be above a 20 for a natural human. A 20 is considered the peak of human ability. 11 or so is average. Below 8 is considered handicapped for an adult human. Note that certain things can increase attributes above 20, such as supernatural powers, magic, cybernetics, etc.</text>

            <text>Character Points (see next section) can be used to purchase Attribute Points for increasing your attributes later on.</text>

            <title><text>Increasing Attributes (optional)</text></title>
            <text>If your attributes aren<rdquo/>t quite where you desire, you will need to get more Attribute Points so you can purchase a better attribute. Each Attribute Point costs 1 Character Point. Once you purchase the number of Attribute Points you want, just look at the table found in the Attributes section above to see how many total Attribute Points you must spend to get that attribute.</text>
            <text>You must pay a number of Attribute Points equal to the difference between what you want, and what you already have. For example: if you currently have an 11 STR (6 Attribute Points) and wish to increase it to a 14 (21 Attribute Points) that will cost you 15 Attribute Points (<math  xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mn>9</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></math>). Since Attribute Points cost 1 Character Point each, going from an 11 in an attribute to a 14 will cost 15 CP.</text>
            <text>Remember to keep track of how many Attribute Points you have spent on your attributes so you can easily increase them at a later date.</text>
            <text>Note that attribute increases are major additions to your character, and they should be role-played as such. Significant attribute changes represent months if not years of hard work! Here are some examples of possible means of increasing attributes:</text>

          <text>All characters have skills. Skills represent what your character has learned and what they know how to do. Other than being useful in game, skills help to distinguish your character from everyone else in the world. Are you going to play a diplomat? You better have diplomacy, law, and similar skills. A warrior? Better have that shield and/or weapon skills handy!</text>
          <text>Skills have a number of pieces of information associated with them. They have a Rank, Associated Attribute, Description, and Level.</text>
          <text>The rank determines how hard a skill is to learn. Higher the rank, the more time and CP it will take to get better at it. Rank 1 skills are the simplest and easiest to learn. Skills that are more difficult have higher ranks. Rank can also be thought of as the <ldquo/>cost<rdquo/> or <ldquo/>price<rdquo/> of a skill.</text>
          <text>An associated attribute tells you what attribute is used in the skill roll. This is the attribute that is used along with any particular skill. This is discussed in more detail below.</text>
          <text>The description will let you know the scope of Actions that a skill encompasses. The things listed are not the only things available under that skill, but just some of the more common applications of the skill. If you have a question, ask your GM about his take on a particular skill.</text>
          <text>Level is how good your particular character is at the skill. You will use CP to purchase levels in a skill, which is discussed below. If you don<rdquo/>t know a skill at all, you have Level 0 in that skill<mdash/>meaning you don<rdquo/>t know anything about it. The more you know about the skill, the higher your level. This is often abbreviated as <ldquo/>Lvl<rdquo/>(alt. <ldquo/>LVL<rdquo/>). You must purchase your skill levels with CP. Below is a simple chart indicating what different levels correspond to:</text>

          <text>Like most of character creation, skills are purchased using CP. The higher the rank, the more expensive it will be. The higher the level you want in the skill, the more expensive it will be.</text>
          <text>For those that are mathematically inclined, here is the formula for determining CP of a particular skill level and rank:</text>

          </figure>
          <text>See the trend?</text>
          <text>If not, here<rdquo/>s yet another way to look at purchasing skills.</text>
          <text>To get level 1 of a skill, you must spend the Rank in CP. To get to the next level, add the rank of the skill to the amount of CP you spent the last time you increase the skill (and just that last increase, not the total amount you<rdquo/>ve spent on the skill) and that is the amount that you need to spend.</text>
          <example>
            <title><text>Computing Skill Cost</text></title>
            <text>I want to purchase the shield skill (rank 2). To get Lvl 1 I would need to spend 2 CP. Now, if I want to go from Lvl 1, to Lvl 2, I would add the rank (2) to the amount I spent on the last level increase (2 CP), to get the new cost, in this case I would need to spend a total of 4 CP (rank of 2 + 2 CP from last purchase). So now the total amount I have spent on this skill is 6 CP. Lets say I<rdquo/>m not happy with my Lvl 2 shield skill, and wish to upgrade it to level 3. I would again take the rank (2) and add it to the amount I spent on the last increase (4) to get the number of CP I must spend to upgrade the skill. In this case, I must spend an additional 6 CP. Therefore, to get a level 3 shield skill (or any skill or rank 2), I must spend a total of 12 CP.</text>
          </example>
          <text>If you take a look at the little chart above, you will see that at the desired skill level (3) the CP cost is a 6, which I then multiply by the rank (2) to get 12 CP, the same thing I got when I did it out by hand.</text>
          <text>Note that the chart will only tell you how many total Character Points. To get the number of CP needed to increase to the next level, just subtract the upper number from the lower one. A more complete version of the above table can be found at the end of this manual.</text>
          <text>Once you are in game and earning experience, you can increase the level of a skill you currently have at least one level in by paying the appropriate CP cost. If you wish to learn the first level of a skill you don<rdquo/>t have yet, it takes a number of weeks of intense studying equal to the rank of the skill.</text>

            <title><text>Skill Specialization (optional)</text></title>
            <section kind="section">
              <title><text>Specialization in most Skills</text></title>
              <text>It is possible to specialize in many skills. When specialized, a character knows more about a certain aspect of the skill than other parts of the skill. In game terms, you are +1 LVL when performing a check in the area of your specialization, but are -4 to your roll when you are performing a check outside of your specialization. Specializing does NOT cost any extra CP.</text>
              <example>
                <title><text>History<rightarrow/>Spanish</text></title>
                <text>Ralf Gr<ouml/>sse-Kunstleve is a historian. Specifically, he is knowledgeable about Spanish history. He has a LVL 3 History skill with a specialization in Spanish History. This means that if Juan had to make a skill check related to Spanish history, he would roll 4 dice. (3 from his LVL, +1 from the specialty.) However, if he had to make a History roll about another kind of history, he would only roll 3 dice, and be at a -4 to his roll.</text>
              </example>
              <text>Note that you can choose to buy a particular skill more than once with different specialties, if you feel like it. When this happens the roll for <ldquo/>outside of specialty<rdquo/>skill checks is the highest of the skill levels -4 +1 for each skill beyond the first.</text>
              <example>
                <title><text>Chemistry<rightarrow/>WMD</text></title>
                <text>Dr. Klotzenstein is a scientist. He has LVL 3 Chemistry with a specialty in Chemical weapons and poisons. As well, he has LVL 4 Chemistry with a specialization in the chemistry of explosives. Dr. Klotzenstein<rdquo/>s rolls are as follows:<itemized-list><item><text>For Weapons/poisons: 4 dice</text></item><item><text>For Explosives: 5 dice</text></item><item><text>For Non-specialty rolls, 5 dice -3.</text></item></itemized-list></text>
              </example>
              <text>It is possible to specialize in most skills. Talk to your GM about specializing to see which skills you think are appropriate and which ones are not.</text>
              <text>Specializing in skills is purely optional.</text>
            </section>
            <section kind="section">
              <title><text>Specialization applied to Weapon skills</text></title>
              <text>It is also possible to specialize in weapon skills. If a character has a specialized weapon skill that means that he is especially proficient with a very specific type of weapon. When wielding a weapon that matches a character<rdquo/>s specialty, that character receives +1 LVL to the skill. This bonus applies to attack (strike) rolls, and defensive rolls (parry), if applicable. When using a weapon that is outside the character<rdquo/>s specialty, the character is at -1 LVL. Note that Weapon skill specialization does NOT affect damage rolls.</text>
              <text>Specializing in a weapons skill costs 3 CP in addition to the normal cost of the skill. Specializing can be applied to all weapon proficiency type skills and the shield skill.</text>
              <example>
                <title><text>Axes<rightarrow/>Nordic War Axe</text></title>
                <text>Bj<oslash/>rgen is a warrior with a liking for the Nordic War Axe. He has the skill <ldquo/>Archaic Weapons: Axes<rdquo/> at level 3. As well, he is specialized in the Nordic War Axe. The total skill cost is 9 CP. That is 6 CP for Level 3 in a Rank 1 skill, Plus 3 CP from the specialization. When welding a Genuine Nordic War Axe<trademark/>in combat, Gunnar has 4 dice. However, when using any other kind of axe Gunnar only has 2 dice.</text>
              </example>
              <text>Note that some unusual or esoteric weapons require specialization. This is because those weapons are different enough from common weapons that they require special knowledge and experience in order to use them properly.</text>
              <text>Most characters that specialize in weapons are very particular about their weapons. For the character it is almost an obsessive-compulsive issue to wield a particular weapon. Generally the weapon must be very specific in order to satisfy the specialty. In medieval campaigns, a weapon specialty might require a sword forged by a particular smith, or arrows made from a certain type of wood. In a modern campaign, a weapon specialty might entail a particular make and model of rifle.</text>
              <text>Specializing in skills is purely optional.</text>

          <title><text>Rules (Rolls)</text></title>
          <text>What would an RPG be without rules? <Apathy/> has a set of rules that allow for just about any occurrence that an imaginative GM can put the players through.</text>
          <text>Lets start with the basics (some of this will be review):</text>
          <text>In <Apathy/>, there are three different types of die rolls. Every time you roll a die when playing <Apathy/>, you will use one of these sets of rules.</text>
          <section kind="section">
            <title><text>Attribute Checks</text></title>
            <text>Attribute checks are required anytime the GM wants to see if you did something solely based on an attribute. They are used whenever a player wants their character to do something tricky. Attribute checks are purely based on a character<rdquo/>s core attributes. They are completely separate from skills. If a player needs to do something based on a particular skill, then see the skill roll section below.</text>
            <example>
              <title><text>Catch a Pack</text></title>
              <text>Barnacleez is trying to catch a pack that was thrown at him. The GM requires him to make a DEX check to see if he successfully caught the pack.</text>
            </example>
            <example>
              <title><text>Swim a Long Distance</text></title>
              <text>Thomas is trying to swim a long distance while carrying a heavy load. He has to roll a BLD check to see if he has enough stamina to make the swim.</text>
            </example>
            <example>
              <title><text>Decipher Symbols</text></title>
              <text>Wendy is trying to decipher the meaning of some strange symbols written on a wall. Since she has no applicable skills, the GM determines that she needs to make an INT check in order to figure out what they mean.</text>
              <text>Attribute checks are always rolled the same. Roll ONE twenty-sided die, add the attribute to the die, and add any bonuses or negatives. If the total (die roll + attribute + bonuses + negatives) is 25 or higher, then the check succeeded. If you roll a 1, you fail automatically, no matter what your bonuses or attributes are. If you roll a 20, you succeed automatically, no matter what the negatives might be. For an attribute check, you always roll just one 20-sided die.</text>
            </example>
          </section>
          <section kind="section">
            <title><text>Contest of Attributes</text></title>
            <text>Contests of Attributes occur whenever two characters are competing at something that is largely dependent on an attribute and nothing else. Arm wrestling is a contest of strength. Racing to complete a puzzle is a contest of intelligence. A trivia game would be a contest of wisdom, etc.</text>
            <text>A contest of attributes occurs only when there are multiple competitors (generally two) and only when there is no particular skill involved. For example, arm wrestling is a contest of strength but a game of 1-on-1 basketball is generally not, because basketball is a complex game.</text>
            <text>When a contest of attributes occurs, all competitors roll <roll><num>1</num><face>4</face><bns/></roll> and add the result to their attribute. The highest score wins, and like scores tie. The GM may wish to impose negatives and/or bonuses depending on the exact circumstances of the contest.</text>
            <example>
              <title><text>Douglas vs. Enemy Soldier</text></title>
              <text>Douglas (STR 13) is fighting with an enemy solider (STR 12) over the possession of a single rifle. The GM declares that a contest of strength will resolve who manages to gain possession of the rifle. The GM rolls for the solider (a three) and Douglas rolls a 1. The enemy soldier has a total of 15, and Douglas has 14. Therefore, the enemy soldier wrestles the rifle out of Douglas<rdquo/>s hands.</text>

            <title><text>Skill Rolls</text></title>
            <text>Skill rolls are used whenever a player wants to use one of his character<rdquo/>s skills. They are also used whenever two characters are competing at something (Contest of skills) related to a skill. Skill rolls are also used <ldquo/>to strike<rdquo/> or <ldquo/>to defend<rdquo/> in combat.</text>
            <text>To determine if you are successful in performing a skill, roll a number of D20s equal to the Level you have purchased the skill in. To each die, add your current attribute referenced by the associated attribute value of the skill. Each time a die with this value added to it reaches 25 or above, this is called a success. If you have at least one success, you successfully performed the skill. Rolling a <ldquo/>20<rdquo/> on a die will give you +1 successes to however many you rolled normally. Note that this makes it possible to have more successes than you have levels in a given skill. Likewise, a roll of <ldquo/>1<rdquo/> is -1 successes to your total. If you have negative successes (caused by rolling more 1s than successes) then you have a critical failure! In the case of a critical failure the GM will determine what (negative) outcome happens!</text>

            </figure>
            <text>The GM will give penalties and/or bonuses to your skill roll based on the difficulty of the Action you are performing and what circumstances may be surrounding it. When such a negative or bonus is given, this is subtracted from the associated attribute value, not the number of dice rolled for a skill.</text>
            <text>Basically stated, skill rolls work like this: Roll <roll><num>1</num><face>20</face><bns/></roll> for each level you have in the skill. To each die, add your associated attribute and any negatives or bonuses the GM gives you. If the total on each die is 25 or greater that is a success. If the die rolls a 20, regardless of bonuses, attributes, etc. you get +1 successes. If a die rolls a 1, regardless of bonuses, etc. you get -1 success.</text>
            <text>Note that the Maximum you can ever add to your die roll<mdash/>no matter how high your attribute or bonuses to succeed might be<mdash/>is 20.</text>
            <text>Also, if you are doing something simple with respect to your skill level then you don<rdquo/>t have to roll dice at all. It<rdquo/>s assumed that you succeed examples.</text>
            <example>
              <title><text>Lookup Internet Address</text></title>
              <text>Amy has the Computer Use skill at level 3. She wants to look up an Internet address on the computer that she thinks might give the players some needed information. Since this is a simple task and she has a significant level in the associated skill (Computer Use), then the GM rules that she does so automatically, with no roll needed.</text>
            </example>
            <example>
              <title><text>Investigate Mysterious Person</text></title>
              <text>Amy is still on the Internet. Now she is attempting to dig up some information about a mysterious person. The GM determines that Amy needs to use her Level 2 Investigation skill. Amy has a 13 WIS, the associated attribute for Investigation. The GM tells her that this is a normal difficulty skill, and there is no bonus or negative. So Amy rolls <roll><num>2</num><face>20</face><bns/></roll> for the skill and rolls a 6 and a 13. After adding her WIS to each roll, she has a 19 and a 26. Only the 26 is a success since it is 25 or above. Since she has at least one success, Amy is able to find the information she was looking for.</text>
            </example>
            <example>
              <title><text>Fix a Beater</text></title>
              <text>Chris is trying to fix an old car so he and his fellow characters can use it. The GM determines that this falls under the Mechanic: General skill. Chris has a level 2 in that skill. Furthermore, the GM determines that since the car is in really bad shape, that Chris has a -3 to his roll. Chris has a 12 DEX. Chris rolls his dice and gets a 1 and a 16. (Chris is rolling two dice because he has a level 2 skill) Adding his DEX to those rolls, Chris now has a 13 and a 28. The 13 isn<rdquo/>t 25 or above, so it fails, but the 28 succeeds. So far, Chris has 1 success. However, the <ldquo/>1<rdquo/> Chris rolled is -1 success. So, this gives Chris a total of 0 successes<mdash/>meaning the car didn<rdquo/>t get fixed.</text>
            </example>
            <example>
              <title><text>Shoot a Large Robot</text></title>
              <text>Billy is a cybernetic gunfighter with a 22 DEX. He is trying to shoot an enemy robot. The GM determines that Billy gets a bonus of +3 to shoot the robot because it<rdquo/>s so large. Normally, Billy would roll his dice and add +25 to each one: +22 from his DEX and +3 from the Size bonus. However, this gets capped at +20. Thus, Billy only gets to add +20 to each of his dice.</text>
            </example>
            <example>
              <title><text>Called Shot to Arm</text></title>
              <text>Billy is still fighting the same giant robot. This time, he<rdquo/>s trying to make a called shot and shoot the robot in the arm. The GM determines that Billy gets a +3 bonus due to the robot<rdquo/>s Size, but also a -4 to strike because of the called shot to the arm. Thus, Billy adds up his bonuses: +22 from DEX +3 from Size and -4 for the called shot. This adds up to +21, but the bonus is capped at +20. Again, Billy adds +20 to his dice. Notice that the <ldquo/>+20 cap<rdquo/> is applied AFTER all the bonuses and negatives are added up.</text>

            <title><text>Contest of Skills</text></title>
            <text>A contest of skills occurs when two people are trying to defeat each other in some manner with their skills. If two characters were competing to see who could sing better, the character with the largest number of successes of the singing skill would win. The most common example of this is combat. In order to be successful in a combat situation<mdash/>such as attempting to hit an opponent with a sword while he is blocking with a shield, the initiator (or attacker) of the Action must make more successes than the defender.</text>
            <example>
              <title><text>Tom and the Shopkeeper in a Contest</text></title>
              <text>Tom is attempting to purchase an expensive suit of armor, and doesn<rdquo/>t want to pay full price. So he is attempting to bring the price down by using the Bargaining skill. The shopkeeper also has the Bargaining skill, so a contest of skills ensues. Tom has a skill level of 3, and a WIS of 13 (the associated attribute for Bargaining); the shopkeeper has a level 4 Bargaining (he<rdquo/>s been at it longer than Tom has), and a WIS of 10.</text>
              <text>Tom rolls 3 dice and gets a <ldquo/>14<rdquo/>, <ldquo/>20<rdquo/>, and a <ldquo/>3<rdquo/>. Tom now adds his wisdom (13) to each of these. The GM didn<rdquo/>t give any negatives or bonuses, so that is all that gets added. After adding, the totals are 27, 33, and 16. Two of these are 25 or higher, so Tom has two successes so far. Note that Tom rolled one 20<mdash/>which gives him an additional success. Tom has a total of three successes.</text>
              <text>The shopkeeper rolls four dice (remember, he has a level 4 Bargaining), and gets a <ldquo/>1<rdquo/>, <ldquo/>12<rdquo/>, <ldquo/>15<rdquo/><rdquo/>, and an <ldquo/>18<rdquo/>. After adding the shopkeeper<rdquo/>s WIS of 10, we get the following rolls: <ldquo/>11<rdquo/>, <ldquo/>22<rdquo/>, <ldquo/>25<rdquo/>, and <ldquo/>28<rdquo/>. The 25 and 28 are both successes, but the <ldquo/>1<rdquo/> is a -1 success, so the shopkeeper has 1 total success.</text>
              <text>Tom has 3 successes, and the shopkeeper has 1. Since Tom initiated the bargaining, and has more successes than the <ldquo/>defender<rdquo/>, he is successful in his attempt to reduce the price of the armor. How much is determined by the GM, but it should be commensurate with the number of successes that Tom beat the shopkeeper by.</text>
            </example>
            <text>The winner of a contest of skills is whomever rolled the highest number of successes. The margin of success is based on the difference between the two rolls. For example, if the <ldquo/>winner<rdquo/> had only 1 more success than the <ldquo/>loser<rdquo/>, then the contest was close. However, if the <ldquo/>winner<rdquo/> had three more successes than the loser, then it was a decisive victory!</text>
            <text>Ties are left up to the GM to resolve. The suggested protocol is as follows:</text>
            <text>If the tie occurred on a contest that entails a single past event or is something that is <ldquo/>judged<rdquo/> by outsiders, then the winner is the character with the higher associated attribute. (Example: who can paint a better picture, etc.)</text>
            <text>If the contest entails an ongoing event (such as the haggling over a suit of armor detailed above) then it is assumed that the competitors <ldquo/>keep at it<rdquo/> and a second roll is in order.</text>
            <text>The rules for combat are slightly more complicated; see below.</text>

            <title><text>Skill Rolls and Related Skills</text></title>
            <text>If a character needs to make a skill roll and that character knows other skills that are somehow related to (or are similar to) the skill to be rolled, that character is generally entitled to a bonus to his or her roll. The exact terms of the bonus, including what skills qualify as <ldquo/>related<rdquo/>, is determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. The general rule is that each level of a related skill conveys a +1 to the roll. The maximum possible bonus from related skills is +5, regardless of the circumstances.</text>
            <example>
              <title><text>Paul repairing a device</text></title>
              <text>Paul is attempting to repair an electronic device. The GM asks Paul to roll his Electronics skill, which Paul has at lvl 4. Paul mentions that he also knows the skills Electrical Engineering: 2, Electrician: 3, Mechanic: General: 3, and Communications/Telco: 3. The GM determines that since this device is purely electronic, Paul<rsquo/>s Mechanic skill is of no use. As well, the GM decides that since this device is unrelated to communications, Paul<rsquo/>s Communications skill does not apply either. However, the GM decides that Paul<rsquo/>s Electrical Engineering and Electrician skills are relevant. The GM assigns Paul a bonus of +5 to his roll from his levels in those related skills.</text>
            </example>
            <text>Related Skill bonuses NEVER apply to combat skills or any skill used in a combat situation.</text>
          </section>
          <section kind="section">
            <title><text>All Other Rolls</text></title>
            <text>This type of die rolling is used for just about everything else in the game: rolling damage from combat, the duration of magical spells, or the number of monsters appearing in a group.</text>
            <text>Rolling dice is represented in the <roll><rOff><plusminus/></rOff><raw>R</raw><num>X</num><face>Y</face><bOff><plusminus/></bOff><bns>Z</bns><kind>K</kind></roll><footnote><text>that is, <roll><rOff><plusminus/></rOff><raw>R</raw><num>X</num><face>Y</face><bOff><plusminus/></bOff><bns>Z</bns><kind>K</kind></roll></text></footnote> format; for example <roll><num>3</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns></roll>. This means that you roll three individual 4-sided dice, and add 1 to each die.</text>
            <text>If any die roll with its bonus added in equals or betters the maximum value on a die, then you get a rollover. When a rollover happens, re-roll that die, without any bonus, and add its value to the total. If the roll again has the highest value on the die, then another rollover happens. This keeps going until the highest value on the die is not rolled. Remember, after the first roll, the bonus is not applied; it<rsquo/>s just the raw die roll.</text>
            <text>This may sound confusing, so we<rsquo/>ll work with the example from above. Let<rsquo/>s say you have to roll <roll><num>3</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns></roll>. You get some four-sided dice and roll three of them. Suppose the results are: 1, 3, and a 4. After adding the +1 (from the die bonus), we now have: 2, 4, and 5. We add all the totals up and get 11. Now we have to deal with the rollovers. Because the highest value on a four-sided dice is a 4, we have two rollovers: the 4 and 5. So we roll each of these again, without the original bonus, and get a 2 and 4. We add these to the total yielding 17. But wait, we have yet another rollover (the 4). So we roll that die again, and get a 3. We now have a total of a 20 for our <roll><num>3</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns></roll> die roll.</text>
            <text>The same rules apply for any die. Lets say you are rolling six-sided dice. If any die (after bonuses) has a 6 or higher, then you get a rollover. On an eight-sided die? You guessed it; a roll of 8 or higher will yield a rollover.</text>
            <text>If you have bonuses or negatives to a roll, add them up first, then perform the final roll.</text>
            <text>Note that if there is a minus to the die roll once all the bonuses/penalties are added up, then no rollover is possible. An example is <roll><num>1</num><face>4</face><bOff>-</bOff><bns>1</bns></roll>. Even if you roll a 4 on the die it will be reduced to a 3, which does not yield a rollover. No die (even after negatives) can give a value less than 1. So, if you have a <roll><num>1</num><face>6</face><bOff>-</bOff><bns>4</bns></roll>, and roll a 2 (which would theoretically total -2), then the actual total would be 1.</text>
            <text>Along with what is given above, die rolls might have a raw bonus. This is represented by a bonus in brackets such as this: <roll><num>3</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns><rOff>+</rOff><raw>4</raw><kind/></roll> (alt. <roll><raw>4</raw><num>3</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns></roll> ). Raw Bonuses are added to the resultant total of a die roll, NOT to each die; thus they do not affect rollovers at all. This bonus is added in after all the rollovers are done with. Consider the prior example of <roll><num>3</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns></roll> but with the [+4] added. That would be written <roll><num>3</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns><rOff>+</rOff><raw>4</raw><kind/></roll>. The total using the above numbers would be 24.</text>
            <text>Unless otherwise stated, all non-skill die rolls use this system.</text>

          <title><text>Combat Sequence <and/> Initiative</text></title>
          <text>Combat is based on a system of Rounds, Turns, and Actions. A <ldquo/>round<rdquo/> lasts about five seconds. It is the length of time in which all combatants have done something. Each round is broken down into Actions. An Action lasts about 1 second. Each combatant gets one or more Actions during each round. When all combatants have used up their Actions, the current round is over and a new one starts.</text>
          <text>During your turn, you determine what you wish to do with your available Actions. Almost everything that you do of significance during your turn consumes an Action Simple examples of what can be done in an Action are shooting a gun, swing a sword, moving, or using a mystical ability. Keep in mind that a lot of <ldquo/>boring<rdquo/> combat stuff also takes up Actions: reloading your weapon, moving around, ducking behind cover, or taking an item out of your pack. Some things that you will want to do will consume multiple Actions per turn.</text>
          <text>All characters, by default, have three Actions per round. Certain skills or in-game effects might change this. When combat is going to start, all players need to figure out how many Actions they get. (typically, this will be 3 each).</text>
          <text>At the beginning of combat, all characters must roll initiative. This determines who attacks first in the turn. When combat starts, participants must roll a <roll><num>1</num><face>20</face><bns/></roll> for their initiative. If any characters have more than 3 Actions per turn (due to a skill or magical effect or somesuch), then those characters must roll initiative twice.</text>
          <text>Various bonuses or penalties apply to initiative rolls. Certain skills and magical effects can alter initiative. As well, the GM may apply initiative bonuses or penalties depending on game situations, such as surprise attacks or ambushes.</text>
          <note>
            <text>Most characters will have 3 Actions per turn. All three Actions are taken at the same time, on that character<rsquo/>s initiative.</text>
          </note>
          <example>
            <title><text>Tom<rsquo/>s Turn in Combat</text></title>
            <text>Tom is in combat. Tom has three Actions and he rolled an 11 as his initiative. When it<rsquo/>s Tom<rsquo/>s turn in combat (11), he takes all three Actions at that time.</text>
          </example>
          <text>The character that has the highest initiative goes first, and then the character with the next highest initiative takes their turn, and so forth down the line until all combatants have taken a turn.</text>
          <text>Once all turns are over, the current round of combat is over. It then restarts with everyone<rsquo/>s initiative being the same as it was in the previous round. This progression continues until combat is over. If the combatants change significantly during combat<mdash/>for example, if new characters show up on the scene<mdash/>the GM might want to make everyone re-roll their initiative. If something happens during combat that changes how many Actions the combatants have, the GM should ask that initiative be re-rolled.</text>
          <text>Some things that you might want to do will take up multiple Actions. A common example of this is spell casting, where many spells take several Actions to cast. If you do this, you may need to drag this type of Action across multiple Actions or even multiple turns. For example, let<rsquo/>s say that you want to cast a spell that takes 3 Actions. You can use your first Action to start casting, and then use your second and third Actions to finish casting the spell. At any time you may cancel (stop casting) the spell or ability with no penalty. When an ability or activity requires multiple Actions, it always takes place on the final Action that completes that activity. Also, it is possible to be disturbed or disrupted if you are attacked while performing a multiple-action activity. The GM should take note of this and might impose skill checks or other chances of failure if you get knocked around too much.</text>
          <note>
            <text>Note that everything you may wish to do in combat requires one or more Actions. This includes moving around, drawing a weapon, using items, etc. Undoubtedly, many of your Actions will be used for things other than attacking.</text>
          </note>
          <text>When in combat, some characters may want to delay their Action until later. A character can always choose to <ldquo/>act later<rdquo/> in combat. When doing so the player states what new initiative number he wishes to act on. The new initiative must be lower than his current initiative number. Once a character<rsquo/>s initiative is delayed it remains delayed (though it could be delayed even further). That characters initiative remains at the new, lower, number for the remainder of combat, unless the GM asks all players to re-roll initiative. Actions cannot be split between different initiative numbers. So, a character must either take all his Actions at his normal initiative, or he must delay all his Actions to a later initiative.</text>
          <example>
            <title><text>Tom<rsquo/>s initiative</text></title>
            <text>Tom<rsquo/>s initiative roll is an 18. He and his fellow players were cornered by ogres for whom the GM has secretly rolled initiative. Tom has the highest initiative roll, so he goes first. Tom isn<rsquo/>t exactly sure what to do, so he delays his initiative until <ldquo/>10<rdquo/>. The GM then resumes combat as normal, with the next highest initiative going first. Tom has initiative 10 for the remainder of combat.</text>
          </example>
          <text>Some game effects last a certain number of turns, or have a certain effect each turn. These effects are counted and take place on the affected character<rsquo/>s turn. They only are counted and occur if the character begins that turn with the effect in place. These effects occur at the beginning of that character<rsquo/>s turn in a given round. These effects are automatic and do not consume any time from the character. Resolve all effects before that character takes any Actions.</text>
          <example>
            <title><text>Lucy<rsquo/>s turn in combat</text></title>
            <text>It is Lucy<rsquo/>s turn in combat and she casts Regeneration on herself. The effect of the spell is that each turn she gains <roll><num>1</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns></roll> Hit Points. Now the spell has taken effect, but she does not gain any HP yet, nor does this turn count against the duration of the spell. Now all other combatants take their turns. When it is again Lucy<rsquo/>s turn (next round) she gains her <roll><num>1</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns></roll> HP, just before her first Action This is also considered one turn out of the spell<rsquo/>s duration.</text>
          </example>
          <text>It is possible to <ldquo/>hold an Action<rdquo/> for later. Holding an Action means that the character is maintaining his current initiative number, but is saving an Action for a specific situation. A character may only hold one Action at a time. Furthermore, you must declare what your held Action will be, and under what circumstances. Held Actions are resolved as soon as their conditions are met. Held Actions <ldquo/>expire<rdquo/> if their declared conditions never occur at the beginning of your next turn.</text>
          <example>
            <title><text>Tom holds an Action</text></title>
            <text>Tom<rsquo/>s initiative is 10. During his turn he spends one Action to move behind some cover and another to ready his longbow. Tom declares that he is going to hold his final Action<rsquo/>I am going to cover the hallway with my bow. If I see a goblin come out of the hallway, I<rdquo/>m going to shoot at it<rdquo/>. If a goblin does indeed come out of the hallway (and Tom can see this), then Tom may immediately take his held Action to fire an arrow at it. However, if no goblin comes down the hallway before Tom<rsquo/>s next turn, then the held Action is wasted.</text>

            <title><text>Weapons <and/> Equipment</text></title>
            <text>Most characters will carry equipment in combat. This usually includes weapons and armor. There are no <ldquo/>class<rdquo/> restrictions for weapons or armor. Any character can wear any armor and wield any weapon, provided that the character has the appropriate attributes and skills.</text>
            <text>Weapons have a minimum strength requirement (MSR). The MSR indicates what strength is required of the character to properly wield a given weapon. If the character<rsquo/>s strength is less than the MSR, then the character has -1 to strike and [-1] damage for each point of strength difference.</text>
            <text>The raw damage bonus (RDB) is calculated by subtracting 8 from the wielder<rsquo/>s Str. The RDB is added as raw damage to total of the weapon<rsquo/>s damage. However, all weapons have a maximum strength bonus (MSB); if the RDB is greater than the MSB, then the MSB is used as the RDB instead.</text>
            <example>
              <title><text>MSR for Bosk</text></title>
              <text>Bosk has a STR of 17 and is brandishing a Hercules Club ( <roll><num>3</num><face>6</face><bns/><kind>C</kind></roll> , MSR: 12, MSB: 13). Because Bosk<rsquo/>s Str is higher than the minimum strength requirement of the Hercules Club (12), he is entitled to a damage bonus. Subtract 8 from Bosk<rsquo/>s Str score to calculate his bonus:<math  xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mn>17</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>9</mn></mrow></math>. So this means that Bosk deals <roll><raw>9</raw><num>3</num><face>6</face><bns/><kind>C</kind></roll> damage.</text>
            </example>
            <example>
              <title><text>Bosk with Knife</text></title>
              <text>Suppose Bosk pulls out a long knife ( <roll><num>1</num><face>6</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns><kind>S</kind></roll> , MSR: 8; MSB: 4). Bosk<rsquo/>s Str is significantly higher than the minimum required for the weapon. Calculating his theoretical bonus, we can write: 17 - 8 = 9. At first glance, it appears that Bosk is entitled to a [+9] bonus. However, the maximum strength bonus for the long knife is 4. Therefore, Bosk<rsquo/>s damage roll would be <roll><raw>4</raw><num>1</num><face>6</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns></roll>.</text>
            </example>
            <text>Bows never grant a damage bonus to characters with higher than required STR. However, it is possible to purchase stiffer (stronger) bows that can take advantage of a character<rsquo/>s higher STR score. High-draw bows cost 20<percent/>more for every 1 STR point added to the MSR. For each point, add [+1] damage. This can be stacked. So, a +1 bow costs 20<percent/>extra, a +2 bow costs 40<percent/>extra, etc. Note that the maximum STR requirement that can be added to a bow of a given type is equal to half of its original MSR. Note that the damage and strike penalty for having a lower-than-required STR does apply to bows. Modern compound bows are adjustable and can be set to a higher than normal strength value without incurring additional cost.</text>
            <text>Characters will have two hands that they may use to wield weapons. All weapons are either one-hand or two-handed. Two-handed weapons, of course, require both hands to properly wield. One-handed weapons require only one hand. Therefore a player could wield one single-hand weapon, one two-handed weapon, two single-hand weapons, or one single-hand weapon and a shield or other item. However, when wielding two weapons the character can have penalties. Also, wielding two weapons does not grant the ability to the character to strike with both weapons in one Action In general, wielding two weapons gives the user -3 and -6 to strike with the primary and off -hand (respectively), and requires an additional Action These penalties can be mitigated with skills from Martial Arts.</text>
            <text>Characters that use magic, aside from Martial Magic, must have at least one hand free when casting spells. Characters that use Faith magic must have a holy symbol in their grasp when casting magic; this requires a free hand to hold. Spellcasters are free to use two-handed weapons so long as they aren<rsquo/>t wielding the weapon at the same time as they are casting spells. (Spellcasters can put away a weapon, cast magic freely, and then draw their weapon again, though this takes time)</text>
            <text>All firearms are assumed to be 2-handed by default. However, pistols and submachine guns may be fired with one hand. (See rules for using 2-handed weapons with one hand below). Larger firearms including rifles, shotguns, and heavy weapons (rocket launchers, etc.) must always be used 2-handed. It always requires two hands to reload a firearm, no matter what kind it is.</text>
            <text>Bows are always two-handed weapons. Hand (small) crossbows can be aimed and fired with one hand. However, cocking and re-loading a crossbow always requires two hands. Larger crossbows always require two hands to fire as well as load. Siege weapons, cannons, heavy weapons, etc, always require both hands to be free in order to load, aim, and fire.</text>
            <text>It is possible to use two hands to fight with a one-handed weapon. In this case, the wielder has -1 to strike and effectively adds +3 to his strength.</text>
            <text>It is possible to use some two-handed weapons with one hand. To do so, add 4 to the minimum strength requirement of the weapon. Note that many two-handed weapons always require two hands, period. These are large firearms (rifles, shotguns), staves, pole arms, chains, and bows.</text>

            <title><text>Dual-wielding Weapons or Weapon <and/> Shield</text></title>
            <text>As noted above, it is possible for characters to wield two weapons in combat, or a weapon and a shield. A character cannot attack with both weapons during the same Action unless he takes the Multi-weapon style skill in Martial Arts. A character using a weapon and a shield may not attack with his weapon and shield bash in the same Action for the same reason. When attacking with both weapons the character makes two separate attack rolls, one for each weapon; each attack is resolved separately. This takes two separate Actions.</text>

                </description>
                <text>When wielding two weapons the weapon in the character<rsquo/>s <ldquo/>good<rdquo/> hand receives a -3 to strike and the weapon in the character<rsquo/>s <ldquo/>off<rdquo/> hand receives a -6. Some characters can have <ldquo/>even-more-offhand<rdquo/> weapons, such as a kick (or two), or literally having extra limbs. To calculate the negative to strike for wielding multiple weapons, first find the number of weapons being used, then order them (the strike order). The first weapon is at -3 to strike, the second at -6, the third ad -9, and so on, i.e. the <math  xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><msup><mi>k</mi><mi>th</mi></msup></mrow></math> weapon is at <math  xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mn>-3</mn><mo><times/></mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></math> to strike.</text>

                <text>If the character is wielding a 1-handed weapon in his <ldquo/>good<rdquo/> hand, and his other hand is carrying a shield, a non-weapon holy symbol, or a utility item then there is NO strike penalty at all.

            <title><text>Combat Overview</text></title>
            <text>Resolving an attack is a three-step process:</text>
            <numbered-list>
              <item>
                <text>The attacker makes a strike roll. A strike roll is an attempt to hit an opponent using a weapon or ability.</text>
              </item>
              <item>
                <text>The defender may attempt a defensive maneuver. A defensive maneuver is a special skill that is used to avoid or reduce the damage from an incoming attack.</text>
              </item>
              <item>
                <text>If the attack was successful, damage is rolled, calculated, and applied to the target.</text>
              </item>
            </numbered-list>
            <text>This process is explained in detail below.</text>
          </section>
          <section kind="section">
            <title><text>Attacking</text></title>
            <text>An attack is nearly anything that you try to do to an opponent during your turn. Typically an attack is a physical strike against your opponent with a weapon (such as your fist or a sword), but it could also be the use of a supernatural ability, magic spell, or a modern device such as a gun.</text>
            <text>When you attack, you use one of your skills in an attempt to damage your opponent. Normally, this will be a <ldquo/>basic attack<rdquo/>skill from Martial Arts. Any time you make an attack like this, you roll a Strike Roll. Strike roll is just a special name for a skill roll in combat<mdash/>they work just like normal skill rolls. To recap, roll a number of D20s equal to your level of the skill you are using to attack with (i.e. use the Large Sword skill to strike with your bastard sword), add your attribute and any bonuses or negatives. For each die that hits 25 or better, you have a success.</text>
            <note>
              <text>If you have at least one success, you strike the target.</text>
            </note>
            <text>Otherwise you miss your target.</text>
            <text>Some attacks don<rsquo/>t require a skill roll. This includes special attacks that automatically hit your opponent (such as certain abilities from Martial Arts) as well as magical spells or supernatural powers that are auto-targeting. For example, the magic spell Ray of Heat automatically hits your opponent, with no strike roll needed.</text>

          <section kind="section">
            <title><text>Defending</text></title>
            <text>The target of an attack usually receives an attempt to defend himself.</text>
            <note>
              <text>Defending is using your skills to avoid getting hit by an incoming attack.</text>
            </note>
            <text>There are many different skills that are available for defense. They are called defensive maneuvers. A defensive maneuver is a special skill or ability that you use specifically in response to being attacked; otherwise they work like normal skills. A target of an attack may attempt to use any one defensive maneuver in order to protect himself from the attack. The most common are parrying, blocking, and the Dodge skill. These are described below. Other defensive maneuvers may be found in the Martial Arts section.</text>

                  <text>Parry</text>
                </description>
                <text>Parrying is using your weapon to deflect a blow from another weapon. Parrying may only be performed with melee weapons, against either a melee or hand to hand attack. Parrying is ineffective versus other attacks, such as explosives, bullets, chemical splashes, magical energy, etc. Parry is not a skill itself, rather the skill roll for parrying is based on the weapon skill you are trying to parry with. For example, you would use your Knife skill to parry using your dagger. You must have your weapon drawn and ready in order to use it to parry. Note, that this is the same skill that is used for attacking with your weapon, so most characters will have a good chance at parrying.</text>
                <note>
                  <text>A weapon or similar combat skill is used for parrying. Also note that parrying is always subject to GM approval. The GM determines the outcome of a successful parry, though it usually means that the defender avoids all damage. However, if you are parrying an attack from a heavy or large weapon with a small weapon, the GM might want to impose a different outcome.</text>

                </description>
                <text>Blocking is putting a shield between you and an incoming attack.</text>
                <note>
                  <text>Upon a successful block, a shield<rsquo/>s armor values are added to any armor that you are currently wearing</text>
                </note>
                <text>(see below). You can attempt to block any incoming attack that you are aware of. Blocking can be used against melee attacks, missile weapons, arrows, gunshots, and unusual attacks such as a fireball or an acid splash. Larger shields will make it easier to block, more info can be found in the shields section.</text>
                <note>
                  <text>The Shield skill is used for blocking. Blocking means that the blow hits, but the defender gets to add the armor of the shield to his own armor value.</text>
                </note>
                <text>In the case of a non-standard attack, such as a splash of acid, the shield simply stops a certain percentage of the damage outright.</text>

                  <text>Dodge</text>
                </description>
                <text>one of the best types of defense. Dodge is an (expensive) skill; dodging is moving your body out of the way of an incoming attack. By sidestepping, ducking, throwing yourself to the ground or similar Action you can avoid any attack completely and take no damage. The Dodge skill is used for dodging. On a successful dodge the blow doesn<rsquo/>t hit, period. However, dodge is a high rank skill, so most characters will not be very good at it.</text>
              </item>
            </description-list>
            <text>Now that you know what the types of defenses are, we are going to lump them together and call them <ldquo/>defense<rdquo/> for the sake of simplicity for what is to follow.</text>
            <text>To defend against an attack, you must succeed at your defending skill roll. And you must have MORE successes at the attacker had in his attack roll. For example, if an attacker has 3 successes to strike you, then you would need at least 4 successes at your defensive skill to protect yourself. If you have fewer successes than the attacker, you are struck by the attack. You can only attempt to defend against an attack with one type of defense. You can only try to block, dodge, or parry once per attack but not multiple of these at a time (i.e. you cannot attempt to block and dodge the same attack). You can attempt to parry one attack and then dodge the next attack, however.</text>
            <text>If you are struck you will likely take damage from the attack. Also note that you cannot defend (parry, block, or dodge) an attack that you did not know about!</text>
            <text>Note that there are other defensive maneuvers aside from Dodge, Parry, and Block. These include certain magic spells (Blink, for example), martial arts abilities (such as Preemptive Dodge), or supernatural powers. Regardless of what defense a character chooses to use, only ONE defense maneuver may be used against any one incoming attack.<footnote><text>Some magical spells or super powers of a defensive nature are active for a set duration<mdash/>usually several rounds. Such spells, such as full barrier, are not defensive maneuvers. These spells are independent of defense. A character using such a spell may still use a defensive maneuver if she chooses to. Magical spells, martial arts techniques, and supernatural abilities are considered defense maneuvers whenever they are single-use effects that are used against only one specific attack (such as Blink).</text></footnote><footnote><text>Some attacks, such as automatically targeting magical spells, will strike your opponent regardless of defense. Defensive maneuvers are ineffective against these spells. For example, Ray of Heat as discussed above will always strike its target. Call Lightning will always strike its target, if the caster succeeds on his magical control roll to cast the spell. For these abilities, defensive maneuvers have no effect.</text></footnote></text>

            <title><text>Damage</text></title>
            <text>When an attack hits its target, it will inflict damage upon it. Every weapon has a damage rating associated with it as well as a damage type (for example: a dagger is a <roll><num>1</num><face>6</face><bns/><kind>P</kind></roll> weapon). The damage rating is the amount of damage it will do, and the damage type reflects how the weapon deals its damage.</text>

Normal armor cannot protect against this type of damage. Only your character<rsquo/>s Base Armor (BA) can protect you from undefined damage. Any time someone takes undefined damage he or she will always take at least one point of damage, regardless of the Base Armor.</text>

                <text>extremely damaging attacks deal D damage. There is no way to protect yourself from Direct Damage, as it will bypass all armor and other protections that you have on. Damage from D attacks is subtracted directly from Hit Points (HP).</text>

            <text>Consider the dagger again: <roll><num>1</num><face>6</face><bns/><kind>P</kind></roll> </text>
            <text>This tells us that a strike from a Dagger deals <roll><num>1</num><face>6</face><bns/></roll> damage. Also, we know that it deals piercing damage.</text>
            <text>Ok, so now we<rsquo/>ve got our weapon<rsquo/>s damage rating and it<rsquo/>s damage type. Roll the given damage as described in the dice rolling section at the beginning of the rules section. The higher the damage roll, the more severe the attack was upon the target.</text>
            <text>After the damage roll is determined, subtract that damage from the target<rsquo/>s Hit Points (HP). Armor can reduce the damage taken, which brings us to...</text>

            <title><text>Armor</text></title>
            <text>Armor is any covering that you are wearing or behind that will absorb some of the damage applied to you. All armor is given three numerical ratings for piercing, Slashing, and Crushing protection. The higher any one number is, the better it will protect you from that type of damage. Typically this value sequence is represented as P/S/C (Piercing/Slashing/Crushing). An example would be 3/2/3, which provides 3 points of piercing protection, two points of Slashing protection, and 3 points of Crushing protection.</text>
            <text>When taking damage subtract the armor value, which matches the damage type of the weapon, from the damage amount.</text>
            <text>Here are a few examples:</text>
            <example>
              <title><text>Carlos vs. the Bandit</text></title>
              <text>Carlos was attacked by a bandit with a short sword. The bandit made his skill roll to attack and had three successes. Carlos attempts to parry and had only one success. Since Carlos has fewer successes than the attacker, he fails to parry and takes full damage. The GM rolls damage for the bandit and determines that the bandit<rsquo/>s sword blow deals 8 damage. Carlos is wearing soft leather armor, which has a P/S/C rating of 2/3/0. We know the short sword dealt 8 damage. But it is a Slashing weapon (denoted by the S in the weapon damage), so the armor provides 3 points of protection against this attack. So we take the damage of the weapon (8) and the amount of protection the armor gives (3), and subtract the armor value from the weapon damage. So, Carlos just took 5 damage (8-3=5).</text>
            </example>
            <example>
              <title><text>Lira the Gladiator</text></title>
              <text>Lira is fighting a gladiator-style duel. Her opponent attacks with a spear and has two successes to hit. Lira wants to block and rolls her shield skill. She has four successes on her skill roll. This means that she successfully blocked the incoming attack with her shield. The GM rolls damage for the attack and gets 14 P. (that<rsquo/>s a strong blow!) Lira is using a Splint Shield (P/S/C of 9/9/9) and is wearing Hard Leather armor (3/4/1). First, apply the damage against Lira<rsquo/>s shield. Her shield has an armor of 9 versus P. This means that her shield stops 9 points of the incoming damage. However, since the spear blow dealt more damage than her shield has armor, the weapon continues through her shield<mdash/>which now has a hole in it. Lira now deals with the remaining 5 damage. (14 damage was dealt, minus the 9 taken by the shield = 5). Her armor has a P value of 3, meaning that she only takes 2 points of damage to her HP total. (14 damage - 9 from shield - 3 from armor = 2)</text>
            </example>
            <text>Now that you have that, lets introduce a few tricks. The entire next two paragraphs are incredibly important, so pay attention!</text>
            <text>Weapons that deal undefined or Direct Damage (U or D damage) bypass all armor values. Undefined damage can be protected against by your character<rsquo/>s Base Armor (BA) sub-attribute. Just subtract the BA from the damage taken as if the BA was normal armor. Note that Base Armor is not used for protecting against anything but undefined damage! A target will always lose at least one HP when hit with an attack that deals undefined damage.</text>
            <text>Direct Damage cannot be protected against. Not by normal armor, Base Armor, not anything. it<rsquo/>s harsh, so be careful when on the receiving end of something that deals D damage. D damage is applied directly to your Hit Points.</text>

              <title><text>Armor Piercing</text></title>
              <text>Some weapons have a note that says <ldquo/>AP<rdquo/> followed by some number. This kind of weapon has an unusual ability to pierce armor. If an armored target is struck by a weapon with <ldquo/>AP<rdquo/>, the armor is reduced by the AP number for the purposes of damage calculation. Note, that this cannot go negative. If an <ldquo/>AP: 10<rdquo/> weapon strikes someone wearing 5 armor, then the armor is totally ignored. It does not, however, go to -5.</text>
              <example>
                <title><text>Lira Strikes With Gladius</text></title>
                <text>Lira is wielding a gladius, which is a type of short sword that has AP: 5. She successfully strikes her opponent, and rolls 11 damage. Her opponent has an armor of 7 versus Slashing damage. First, deduct the AP from the armor: 7 armor - 5 AP = 2. Then, deduct the armor from the damage like normal: 11 damage - 2 armor = 9 damage. Lira<rsquo/>s opponent takes 9 damage.</text>
              </example>
              <text>Consider the same situation as above, but assume that Lira<rsquo/>s opponent<rsquo/>s armor is only a 3 versus Slashing. First, deduct the AP form the armor: 3 armor - 5 AP = -2. However, this cannot be negative, so we cap it at zero. Now, deduct the result from the damage: 11 damage - 0 = 11. Lira<rsquo/>s opponent takes all 11 damage.</text>
              <text>AP is effective against armored targets, but it does nothing against unarmored targets. Note, that most weapons with AP don<rdquo/>t deal very much damage. It is usually a good idea to use AP weapons versus armored targets only, and use <ldquo/>normal<rdquo/> weapons versus unarmored targets.</text>

              <title><text>Fire (F)</text></title>
              <text>Some weapons and spells have a note that says <ldquo/>F<rdquo/>, <ldquo/>Fire<rdquo/>, <ldquo/>Fire Effect<rdquo/>, or<rdquo/> U Fire<rdquo/>. These weapons deal fire damage. Unless stated otherwise Fire weapons deal U damage. As well, Fire effect weapons will ignite the target, as well as readily flammable materials within a 3<rdquo/> radius of the blow. A target that is <ldquo/>on fire<rdquo/> will suffer an extra <roll><num>1</num><face>6</face><bns/><kind>U</kind></roll> damage each turn that the fire is still going. This starts on the <ldquo/>next<rdquo/> turn after the target is struck. Certain types of armor have Fire Protection. This means that this armor has the unique ability to resist heat and the damage caused by fire-effect sources. If a target with fire protection is struck with a fire-effect attack, damage dealt from the fire is zero and the target is not ignited. Fire protection on armor will only work three times before the armor must be repaired or replaced. Some armor is rated fire protection<math  xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><times/></math>2, which will take six fire-effect hits before loosing it<rsquo/>s fire resistance, etc. Note that fire protection armor only resists the ignition effect and any heat (U) damage from the fire specifically. Therefore, if a weapon deals normal damage (P/S/C) AND has either Fire effect or Fire damage (U) then the fire-related effects are prevented but the standard damage (P/S/C) is treated as normal. Targets that are <ldquo/>on fire<rdquo/>suffer the damage on each of their turns.</text>
              <example>
                <title><text>David deals Fire damage</text></title>
                <text>David shoots a Ghoul with a Flame blaster. This weapon deals <roll><num>2</num><face>6</face><bns/><kind>U</kind></roll> Fire. David rolls damage and ends up with 10 U. The target suffers the 10 damage. As well, the Ghoul suffers the fire effect and has been set on fire. On the ghoul<lsquo/>s next turn it will suffer <roll><num>1</num><face>6</face><bns/><kind>U</kind></roll> from being on fire. This will continue until the fire is somehow put out.</text>

                <text>Travis is wearing Ceramic Plate armor and is shot with a 12-ga shotgun loaded with a meteor round. The meteor round deals <roll><num>5</num><face>6</face><bns/><kind>C</kind></roll> + Fire and Travis<rsquo/>s armor has 8 points of protection vs. C, and has Fire protection. The attacker rolls 19 C damage. Travis takes 11 damage from the C portion of the blow, but his armor resists the ignition effect so he is not set on fire and suffers no further damage from the attack.</text>

            <title><text>Hit Points</text></title>
            <text>Hit Points are numbers used to represent how injured or healthy a character is. A character will have TWO Hit Point numbers. Your maximum Hit Points determines how tough your character is at full health. This number will rarely change. It is determined by your BLD and WIL attributes, and will rarely change unless your attributes change.</text>
            <text>Your current Hit Points is the most important number. It will likely change frequently during combat. Hit Points are generally represented as a fraction:<math  xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mfrac><mi>Current HP</mi><mi>Max HP</mi></mfrac></math>. When the game begins, your character will be fully healthy and uninjured. Thus, when starting, your current HP will be equal to your maximum.</text>
            <text>As you get injured, any damage you take (after applying armor, etc.) will be applied to your current HP. As you get injured, your current HP drops. Over time, your body will heal itself, and your HP will go up. Seeking medical attention will speed this process. Other things, like magic or cybernetic devices, can heal you as well.</text>
            <text>Your current HP can never exceed your maximum HP. As a general rule for minor injuries (less than 5 HP), you gain back 1 HP per day of average activity. For significant HP losses, it takes<math  xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>Maximum</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>Current</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math>days to fully recover your HP.</text>
            <text>If a character is resting and is under basic medical care, then your healing time is cut in HALF. If your character is under the care of a professional Doctor or Healer, healing time is cut to one QUARTER of normal time.</text>
            <text>If your current HP falls below 0, your character falls unconscious. It is possible to remain conscious by making a willpower check at -X, where X is the amount below zero your HP are. If your current HP are below 0, your character is bleeding badly (internal bleeding is possible too) and you will loose 1 HP per round, unless you receive medical attention. If your current HP ever reaches the negative of your maximum HP, you have died.</text>

            <title><text>Called Shots</text></title>
            <text>Whenever a character attacks he is aiming for the most convenient blow that he can make. It is assumed that this is a <ldquo/>center mass<rdquo/> attack: In other words, the attacker hits the largest, most obvious, portion of the target<rsquo/>s body. For humans and most animals this is the torso area.</text>
            <text>However, there are times when a character may want to strike a specific part of the target<rsquo/>s body. Attacks that are aimed at a specific portion of a target are called shots. Called shots may be attempted with any kind of attack or weapon. The attacker must be able to see and identify the exact target that he is trying to hit.</text>
            <text>When performing a called shot the attacker must declare in advance that he is making a called shot, and where he is aiming. It takes one action for the character to identify and focus on the specific target that he wants to hit. A called shot always incurs a strike penalty. Consult the called shot table on the reference sheet for the appropriate negative. If the attacker fails his strike roll, then the attack missies completely. (It does not, for example, hit <ldquo/>normally<rdquo/> as opposed to the called target). If the attacker makes his strike roll, then the target may defend as normal.</text>
            <text>A called shot cannot be attempted with an auto-targeting magic spell, such as Ray of Heat; these effects always strike <ldquo/>center mass<rdquo/>. However, called shots may be attempted with magical spells that require a roll, such as Fireball or Call Lightning.</text>
            <text>The effects of a called shot are left up to the GM to resolve on a case-by-case basis. The effects would depend on the location of the called shot and also the amount and nature of the damage dealt.</text>
            <example>
              <title><text>Philip misses the troll</text></title>
              <text>Philip has engaged a troll in combat, and declares that he wishes to make a called shot, aiming for the troll<rsquo/>s head. The GM assigns a strike penalty of<mdash/>8 for the called shot. Philip fails his strike roll, and therefore misses the target completely.</text>
            </example>
            <example>
              <title><text>Morgdar is fighting a lizardman.</text></title>
              <text>He attempts to make a called shot targeted at the lizardman<rsquo/>s eye. He successfully makes his called shot and the lizardman fails to defend. The GM asks that damage be rolled. Morgdar<rsquo/>s spear deals 3 damage. The GM rules that enough damage has been dealt to put out the lizardman<rsquo/>s eye, thereby preventing it from attacking properly in combat. The GM notes that had Morgdar rolled higher damage, then the blow could have been instantly lethal.</text>

            <title><text>Cover</text></title>
            <text>Cover is something that a character or a creature is obscured by. Cover has two effects:</text>
            <numbered-list>
              <item>
                <text>Cover can make a target, or a specific part of a target, difficult to see and therefore difficult to hit in combat.</text>
              </item>
              <item>
                <text>Cover can act like armor, which can reduce or even prevent damage that would otherwise harm a target.</text>
              </item>
            </numbered-list>
            <text>A target has cover if there is something between the attacker and the target. This something could be foliage, walls, other combatants, etc. The exact amount of cover should be determined by the GM. A target has total cover when the target is completely obscured by the covering object. In the case of total cover, the attacker cannot see the target.</text>
            <text>An attacker has two options when confronted with a covered target.</text>
            <text>Attempt to strike around cover: The attacker takes aim at part(s) of the target that are not behind cover. This assigns a negative to the attacker<rsquo/>s strike roll, which is determined by the GM. Refer to the reference sheet for sample strike penalties for cover. The attacker may also attempt a called shot against a portion of the target<rsquo/>s body that is not behind cover using the normal called shot negatives. If the attacker fails the strike roll, then the attack misses, period.</text>
            <text>Attempt to strike through cover: The attacker strives to hit the target like normal, trusting that the weapon will penetrate the cover and strike the target anyway. When doing so, the attacker has a<mdash/>2 to strike regardless of the severity of the cover. This<mdash/>2 is in addition to any other penalties that might be present as well. Then, deduct the armor value of the cover from the damage dealt by the attack, just as if the defender were using a shield.</text>
            <text>A target that has total cover is completely hidden, and may not be targeted at all.</text>
            <text>A magic using character may still attack using an auto-targeting spell if ANY portion of the target<rsquo/>s body is visible. This incurs no strike penalty whatsoever. However, if the magical effect is impeded by the cover, then damage may be reduced.</text>
            <text>The act of ducking behind cover will give a bonus to Dodge rolls. However, the cover does not provide a strike penalty or armor unless the targeted character was already behind the cover before the attack started (in which case there is no dodge bonus).</text>
            <text>Targets that are actively attempting to hide behind cover are often restricted in their movements. When using cover, defenders are at<mdash/>3 to all defensive maneuver rolls that they choose to use. Note that if the cover is sufficiently large then it doesn<rdquo/>t require any special effort to hide behind it. In this case there is no penalty to defensive maneuvers.</text>
            <example>
              <title><text>Darin and her comrades are fighting a group of trolls.</text></title>
              <text>One troll has ducked behind some rocks. The GM states that the troll has half cover due to hiding behind the rocks. If Darin wants to shoot the troll with her crossbow, she has<mdash/>8 to strike, OR she may choose to make a called shot against some part of the troll that is not behind cover. In that case she must take the called shot penalty for whatever target she selects.</text>
            </example>
            <example>
              <title><text>Mikus is in a gunfight.</text></title>
              <text>His opponent, a local gangster, has ducked behind the door of a nearby car. The GM rules that the gangster has dense cover, and thus Mikus has<mdash/>12 to strike him. Mikus decides he<rdquo/>d rather take chances with the armor value of the car<rsquo/>s door rather than try and shoot the gangster at such a high penalty. Mikus takes aim at where he thinks the gangster<rsquo/>s body is situated behind the car door<mdash/>thereby incurring a<mdash/>2 for attempting a shot through cover. Mikus makes his roll. Rolling damage for his .224 BOZ, he deals 19 damage. The car<rsquo/>s door provides 8 armor<mdash/>not enough to stop the bullet. The unfortunate gangster suffers the remaining 11 damage.</text>

          <title><text>Additions</text></title>
          <text>There are two basic types of addition augmentations. The first are small devices that don<rdquo/>t take up a lot of room. These are easy to add to the body because they don<rdquo/>t require any power or a lot of space. As a general rule, this type of augmentation is very small and its function is often limited.</text>
          <text>The second type are larger, complex systems, which take up a lot of space in the body. Generally, the only way to add something like this to your body is to remove, move, replace, or otherwise modify some other part of your body in order to accommodate it. This works on a system of slots (see below) which is similar to the Mecha system.</text>
        </section>
        <section kind="section">
          <title><text>Replacements</text></title>
          <text>Augmentation replacements, in their most basic forms, are exactly the same function-wise as normal body parts. Of course, many augmentation parts are upgrades of some sort. They might be stronger, faster, or more durable than normal. Some augmentation replacements have new functions or different abilities than normal.</text>

          <title><text>Augmentation Limbs and Bodies</text></title>
          <text>Entire limbs or even entire bodies may be replaced with augmented versions. There are two basic types of replacement limbs and bodies: Robotic or Cybernetic.</text>
          <text>Robotic limbs are built entirely from non-organic materials. They are machines made of steel, high-tensile alloys, wires and high pressure hoses. Movement comes from hydraulics, electric motors, gears and levers. Robotic body parts contain no flesh or blood.</text>
          <text>Cybernetic limbs are basically organic. They consist of bone, tendons, and muscles just like <ldquo/>natural<rdquo/> limbs. However, cybernetic limbs are enhanced with technology including electric implants, genetically modified tissues, and some synthetic material reinforcements.</text>
          <text>These rules apply to cybernetic and robotic components:</text>

                <text>Cybernetic parts are usually built around the users body. Used cybernetic parts are valuable, but the potential market is limited to those people who are very similar to the original owner. Therefore the used cybernetic parts market tends to be flooded with supply for which it is difficult to find a buyer. It is often time consuming to find a donor or source for a particular part. Cybernetics parts prices for both buyers and sellers will vary wildly depending on market conditions, which are nearly impossible to predict.</text>

                <text>Armor has 3 main values: Piercing, slashing, and crushing. Armor values are represented by 3 numbers separated by slashes (represented by: P/S/C; piercing/slashing/crushing). Example: Armor with values of 4/3/7 would have 4 points of protection vs. Piercing, 3 vs. Slashing, and 7 vs. crushing damage.</text>

                <text>All non D/U damage has an associated damage type to is; either P, S, or C. Subtract all matching armor values of the character from the damage being done. If the damage value is still above 0, then the character takes that amount of damage.</text>

                <text>A weapon with an armor piercing (AP) attack will list the amount of AP it has. Subtract this AP number from all of the armors damage values when determining its protection against the attack. This cannot drop the armors value below 0.</text>

                <text>Hard Armor is any armor that uses hard ceramic/plastic/metallic/wooden plates or coverage to protect the character. Hard armor is MUCH more durable than non-hard armor. Hard armor is denoted byhardon the armor sheet. Note that the components of hard armor are hard. They cant be bent without damaging the armor. Hard armor is generally made specifically for the wearer, it will only fit others with nearly identical body proportions.</text>

              <item>
                <text>Armor can be layered, but only one hard suit can be worn at a time. A person can have different hard armors on different parts of the body. Non-hard armors can be layered indefinitely. Add all armor values of the armors together to give the full armor protection. If any armor has fire protection, fire will be stopped, but any armor on top of it is still susceptible to the fire.</text>

          <text>Most energy weapons are powered by a battery pack. These are interchangable between weapons. Energy within the packs is consumed as the weapon is fired, like normal bullets. They are called <ldquo/>batts<rdquo/> or <ldquo/>b-paks<rdquo/> in slang. B-paks store energy in units of EU. Different weapons consume EU at different rates. Smaller weapons use 1 EU per shot. Larger weapons might use more. Pistols can hold ONE pack. Rifles/cannons can usually hold 3. B-paks can be recharged. Recharging a pack takes about thirty seconds per EU that has been used. As a general rule, it costs <dollar/>1 per EU to have pack recharged. HD paks require special equipment to charge and these cost about <dollar/>1.50 per EU to charge.</text>

          <text>For damage type listed as X/Y, the weapon can deal either type of damage for a given attack. For a P/S weapon, the attcker can choose to do a P or S attack. For every point of STR under Min. STR, the attack gets -1 damage and -2 to strike/parry. STR Req is the minimum strength required to wield the weapon. For every point of STR over the Strength Requirement, add one point of damage to the raw roll, up to a maximum of the MSB (Max Strength Bonus) A raw bonus is always indicated with square brackets. So <roll><num>3</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns><rOff>+</rOff><raw>4</raw><kind/></roll> would be a normal <roll><num>3</num><face>4</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns></roll> roll, with an additional 4 added to the final result. When wielding a 1-H weapon with two hands, assume the wielder has +2 STR.</text>

                <item>
                  <text>Plasma weapons are a bladeless handle (typically looks like a normal weapon handle or a flashlight) from which a glowing blade of extremely hot plasma vents forth. The plasma is held in the shape of a cylinder (or blade) by a magnetic field. They take an action to turn on.</text>
                </item>
                <item>
                  <text>Due to the difference between using a plasma weapon verses normal weapons, they require the Archaic Weapons - Energy skill to use. Anyone can use their normal sword skill (or axe skill respectively) but will get a critical failure on a 4 or below (instead of the normal 1).</text>
                </item>
                <item>
                  <text>Plasma weapons cannot be parried by non-plasma weapons, likewise, they cannot parry non-plasma weapons. Similarly, shields cannot block plasma weapons. Plasma weapons can parry other plasma weapons, and force fields protect against them as normal If a plasma weapon comes in contact with another one, there is a 25chance the magnetic fields of the blades will lock together. It is easy to tell if combatants are locked as an extremely bright glow emanates from the contact point of the weapons. Getting out of a lock requires an action where a strength contest ensues. If there is more than a difference of 8 between the two strength rolls, the lock is broken and the loser loses his or her next action. If no break occurs, the combatants must attempt again on the next action. Either combatant in a lock can turn off their weapon, in which case he or she automatically loses the lock challenge, and gets the same negative as if he lost due in a STR contest.</text>
                </item>
                <item>
                  <text>One side effect of having a magnetic field around the blade, is that it is possible to parry projectile energy attacks (such as shots from a beam rifle). Doing so the wielder is at a -8.</text>

            <text>Rocket-assisted weapons are modern versions of traditional archaic weapons. They have small rocket motors contained in the weapon. When the weapon is swung, the motor ignites, giving extra force to the blow. They are used with the same skill as normal archaic weapons.</text>
            <text>If such a weapon is used, and the target is missed, then it takes an extra two actions to recover. If the target is hit but the blow is parried or blocked, then it takes the normal time to recover.</text>
            <text>When using rocket assisted weapons, you need an extra success to parry melee attacks. (At least two better than attacker.)</text>
            <text>Each weapon can store up to 5 <ldquo/>rocket charges.<rdquo/> When these are used up, they must be refilled before the weapon can be used. Each charge costs <dollar/>100 to refill.</text>

          <title><text>Introduction</text></title>
          <text>Magic exists in many forms. It is a supernatural energy that permeates everything in the world. Characters with the right skills can bend this energy to their will<mdash/>and perform amazing feats in the process. Magic is capable of healing the sick, raising the dead, creating a great fireball, protecting the caster from harm<mdash/>and nearly anything else you can imagine.</text>
          <text>Magic, whatever type it might be, is all about manipulating MANA. Mana, as mentioned above, is a supernatural energy that is present in everything. It is in the air, the ground, in your food, even in your body. Mana is what is responsible for <ldquo/>enforcing<rdquo/> physical laws such as gravity, etc. When a person uses magic, they are manipulating mana to do what they want. Normally, this is the mana that is in their own body. It is possible to work with mana outside one<rsquo/>s body as well. Nobody really knows exactly how mana works, but special gestures and body movements handed down throughout time are believed to initiate complex quantum-mechanical events that result in seemingly impossible things taking place<mdash/>magic.</text>
          <text>Mana is found in all things. However, more mana is found in some things than others. Gases (air, for example) have very little mana. Denser substances such as water and stone have more mana. Complex things such as man-made objects (pottery, woodcarvings, machinery, etc.) contain quite a lot of mana. Living things, from mice to humans to whales, contain even more mana. Mana is released back into the environment when living things die, or when mana-rich objects decay, are burned, or broken. Other objects tend to <ldquo/>soak up<rdquo/>mana that is released near them. Thus, older items tend to contain more mana than do <ldquo/>new<rdquo/> ones. Whenever an item is broken it is possible to extract some of its mana as it dissipates back into the environment. This is also possible when a living creature dies. In game terms, we call mana <ldquo/>MP<rdquo/>(Mana Points / Magic Points).</text>

          <title><text>Types of Magic</text></title>
          <section kind="section">
            <title><text>Invocation Magic (spellcasting)</text></title>
            <text>Invocation spellcasting is the most common and basic form of magic. This is the art of the wizard and sorceress, where characters use innate mana to cast spells. Invocation spells are based on methodical, practiced, gestures and chanting of magical incantations.</text>
            <text>Incantation magic is learned. The invocation magician will have a list of spells that she has studied and memorized. As long as she has mana (MP) available, she may cast any spell that she knows. Because invocation magicians use innate mana and well defined, repeatable, forms it is the easiest type of magic to learn.</text>
            <text>Spells are learned from other magicians, studious research, or a combination of the two. Research requires access to various books on the subject of magic, including book(s) that are specifically about the spell to be learned. True books on magical subjects are few and far between, and books about high level spells are extremely valuable. Invocation magicians have invented a special language to record and describe magic spells and the procedures required to cast them. All true magical books will be written, at least in part, in this special language. Wizards and Sorceresses might hail from different countries, races, and moral standpoints<mdash/>but they all share common ground in the ability to read magical script. Magical script is specially designed to describe and transcribe magical spells, therefore it is rarely used for other purposes. It is difficult to carry on a conversation, written or spoken, in the language of magic.</text>
            <text>More often than not a wizard will belong to a particular clan or school, where many wizards pool their knowledge and references for members to share. In such situations there will usually be more experienced spellcasters that may teach their skills to junior members. Wizards may be children of existing wizards or they might be apprentices or students at an established wizard<rsquo/>s school or place of business. Wizard secret societies are common as well. Some are devoted to particular schools of magic. Others are devoted to a certain cause and happen to share arcane secrets to persue common goals. Wizard secret societies and wizard schools are places where other wizards can learn new spells and find magical items. However, most magic secret societies have a strict hierarchy and code of conduct. Special oaths, tithes, and obedience to the order are often required, and favors always entail repayment.</text>
            <text>Spells are purchased (learned) similar to skills. However, there are no levels for spells. A character either knows a given spell, or they don<rdquo/>t. If you like you can think of this as a <ldquo/>level 1 skill<rdquo/>.</text>
            <text>There exist different schools (aka categories) of magic. Some Wizards specialize in certain schools, but that is purely optional. Any character may learn spells from any category<mdash/>but with the following restrictions. A character may only learn a given spell if she knows at least one spell of lower rank from the same school. As well, the rank of the spell must be no higher than your Spellcasting skill level. For example, you cannot learn a rank 4 <ldquo/>Air<rdquo/>magic spell unless you already know a rank 3 <ldquo/>Air<rdquo/>spell, AND you must have Level 4 or higher Spellcasting.</text>
            <text>You can learn any spell, regardless of type, if you have a spellcasting skill at least three levels higher than the rank of the spell. For example, if you have a spellcasting skill level of 6, then you could learn any spell of rank 3 or lower, regardless of school or prerequisite lower-rank spell.</text>
            <text>A character with level 1 or higher spellcasting can always learn Rank 1 magical spells from any school without restriction.</text>
            <text>Note that a Wizard or Sorceress character must have at least one level in Magical Studies in order to read spell books and to learn the intonations required for magical incantations. Beyond that Magical Studies is a purely optional skill.</text>
            <text>Characters that cast Invocation magic must have at least two free points of Encumberance available. If not, they are not able to cast magic.</text>

            <title><text>Ritual Magic</text></title>
            <text>Ritual magic is performed in elaborate <ldquo/>performances<rdquo/> involving a much human involvement. Magic rituals involve material components (ingredients) and a great deal of chanting, mumbling, gesturing, and the like. The traditional image of a witch, bent over a bubbling cauldron containing newt eyes and salamander toenails is a good example of ritual magic. Whereas traditional spellcasting is an almost scientific pursuit, ritual magic is more of an art. Rituals are conducted with a trained eye and experience. Because ritual ingredients vary in quality and potency, precision has little use. Ritual magicians are shamans, witches and warlocks.</text>
            <text>Ritual magic is not religious. In fact, it is no more religious than making a bowl of oatmeal or mixing some cement. However, in many cultures ritual magic is heavily associated with religion, especially in primitive, animistic, or tribal societies. In these cultures ritual magic is the domain of the <ldquo/>witch doctor<rdquo/> or <ldquo/>medicine man<rdquo/><mdash/>people who hold important positions in the tribe, often including that of a kind of priest or spiritual leader. Therefore, there is a strong association between ritual magic and primitive, pagan, religions. Many ritual magicians are religious figures, members of mysterious cults, etc. Some ritual magicians have been known to practice animal or even human sacrifice (an excellent, though horrific, source of MP for rituals). In these societies ritual magic is often believed to be religious in nature despite the fact that it is decidedly not.</text>
            <text>Ritual magic users do not use innate MP to perform magic. Rather, they use material components (ingredients) to create magical effects. Performing rituals requires a large amount of space and various supplies and components. Ritual preparation and casting is a time consuming and often messy proposition. Therefore, most ritualists have a set area where they can store their materials and perform rituals: usually a quiet location away from prying eyes. This might be a purpose-built room in the home or a secret <ldquo/>lair<rdquo/> in a basement or abandoned building. It might even be a cave or hidden woodland grotto. Such an area is a very personal space for the ritualist, and while it might be neatly organized or highly messy, it will be arrayed exactly how its owner prefers.</text>
            <text>Most ritual supplies are re-useable, and a ritualist<rdquo/>s <ldquo/>kitchen<rdquo/> will be well stocked with such items. These include such things as wands, knives, scales, measuring devices, a fireplace, cauldrons, bottles, pots, strainers, mirrors, precious gems, candles, assorted tools, and so on. Approximately <dollar/>1000 * Rank worth of supplies is required in a ritualist<rdquo/>s <ldquo/>kitchen<rdquo/>. (In other words, in order to perform the Ritual Stoneform, which is a rank 6 spell, <dollar/>6000 worth of supplies are required to be on hand) These supplies are reuseable and are used for many different rituals.</text>
            <text>Specific spells require different ingredients. Ingredients could be nearly anything, including herbs and roots, body parts (animal and human), minerals, chemicals, plants, and so forth. Some of these are common and will be used for many different spells. Others are quite specific and rare, and have very specific applications. A ritualist will usually have a personal stockpile of ingredients and components stored away. This stockpile will usually include all but the most expensive of components. Of course, some components can be difficult to find and some must be fresh, so any ritualist will definately have the means to locate components that she needs. Some components might be gathered personally, through the use of skills such as herbalism, alchemy, hunting, or scrounging. Other components are purchased by the ritualist. Some components may be purchased at common merchants while others must be purchased from special (and sometimes illicit) vendors. Most ritualists will have known connections through which different components and supplies might be shared, purchased, or loaned.</text>
            <text>The cost of ingredients for a particular spell is approximately 1/10 of the <ldquo/>scroll or potion<rdquo/> cost from the spell chart. This assumes fair prices in an open market. However, this cost might vary greatly depending on various circumstances. For example, in a certain town components for Fire spells might be common and therefore very inexpensive, while components for Earth spells might be rare and therefore much more expensive.</text>
            <text>In addition to its specific <ldquo/>recipe<rdquo/>, any ritual spell will also require the infusion of mana. As mentioned above, in ritual magic the MP does not come from the caster. The caster must gather objects containing sufficient MP to conduct the spell. As mentioned above, mana is present in nearly everything, but generally not in sufficient quantity to do any good. Therefore, the ritualist must seek out items that are rich in MP to use when conducting a ritual. This process results in the destruction of the items used! This might even entail the sacrifice of living things<mdash/>if such an amount of MP is required. Generally, items yielding MP for ritual use will cost about <dollar/>1 per MP required, though this will vary. Much like individual spell components, a ritualist will tend to hoard items that may be sacrificed for MP. Common items are living plants and small animals, antiques, old artwork, fossils, old holy items, old clothing (especially from special occasions) and well-used household goods. MP-source items are not spell-dependant. MP items can be used for ANY spell.</text>

            <text>Ritual magicians may also perform a ritual in a special manner, infusing the spell into an object, such as a weapon or magical totem. Infusing a spell takes the same amount of time as performing the ritual in normal fashion. Once the spell is infused in an item, it may be released very quickly. Releasing a charge (the energy and magical effects of a stored ritual) requires 1 action, regardless of the original casting time of the spell. Infused ritual items are only good for twenty-four hours, at which point the charge is lost and the item returns to normal. The ritualist may create charges of extended duration when he first performs the infusion, but each 24 hours of time requires another batch of the requisite spell ingredients (not Mana). Therefore, it can become very expensive to make long duration infused items. An infused item may be used by anyone, not just the ritualist.</text>

            <title><text>Religious <and/> Faith Magic</text></title>
            <text>Religious magic is magical effects that are brought into reality by the combined will of the caster and the caster<rsquo/>s god(s). Whereas primitive religions and cults tend towards the use of ritual magic, Religious or Faith magic is practiced by priests of clearly defined and well organized religions. Most religions that practice Faith magic have a clearly organized hierarchy within the church. Religious dogma and/or scripture is well defined and is extensively documented. Faith-magic using religions are not necessarily <ldquo/>good<rdquo/>, but they are usually known to the general public and often actively recruit new members.</text>
            <text>Religious magic is taught by a particular Church. Each faith has one or more magic schools associated with it. These nearly always include Spiritual and Life magic, and may include others. Most faiths have 3 or 4 schools of spells. A faith caster has access to all spells in the school(s) associated with his Faith, except those whose rank is higher than his level of faith, and those which are specifically prohibited by his Church. For example, a <ldquo/>good<rdquo/> tending religion would typically deny harmful Life-magic spells to their adherents, for example curse.</text>

            <text>Priests, monks, and warriors of faith practice religious magic. All religious spells are channeled through a holy symbol (see below).</text>
            <text>Once a day the caster must engage in prayer. The exact means of praying is left up to the players <and/> GM, but during this time the priest will choose which spells he as access to for the remainder of the day. The caster may choose any combination of spells he has access to, provided that he has enough MP (at the time of prayer) for that particular combination. The caster must allocate MP and spells during this prayer session. Until the next prayer session those are the spells the caster may use. A holy symbol of at least +0 quality is required for this prayer, otherwise the caster cannot allocate spells for that day.</text>
            <text>A faith magic user always uses the Faith skill for any and all magic-related skill rolls, including those that would normally require Spellcasting or Magical Control, etc.</text>
            <text>A Holy Symbol is always required to cast Faith magic. If a holy symbol is not available, then Faith magic simply cannot be cast. Thankfully, a simple gesture or trinket often suffices. There are different types of holy symbols. <ldquo/>Better<rdquo/> and more significant holy symbols offer a better bonus to Faith magic casting:</text>

            <title><text>Martial Magic / Super Power Combat</text></title>
            <text>Martial magic is the ability to perform supernatural <ldquo/>attacks<rdquo/> in conjunction with normal combat, such as fist fighting, martial arts, or combat with weapons.</text>
            <text>Martial Magic always works in conjunction with some kind of verbal or somatic component. This means that the fighter must perform a particular combat form (kata), stance, or must shout a particular phrase in order to use the ability.</text>
            <text>Martial magic is always taught from master to student. It is a closely guarded secret of warrior secret societies, secluded martial arts temples, or families with great fighting traditions. Once a warrior masters the traditional (non-supernatural) combat arts, he may be taught martial magic. Since martial magic is highly dependent on particular combat forms and stances, it is nearly impossible to learn on one<rsquo/>s own or from a book.</text>
            <text>Magical effects that ordinarily require touch do so for the martial magician as well. This is normally done by striking the target with some kind of melee attack. The character does not have to deal damage per se (if the target is wearing armor) but he must connect with a solid blow. The magical energy (effect) is transferred through the blow. Martial magic users may choose to use a normal touch instead.</text>
            <text>Magical effects that are projectile in nature (such as Fireball) and normally require a strike roll must be used in conjunction with a missile or projectile weapon of some kind (thrown weapon, arrow, dart, or even a bullet).</text>
            <text>Magical effects that are autotargeting when performed by a spellcaster (such as Lightning Bolt) are no longer autotargeting. The Super Power combatant must strike with any attack of his choice, which may be a ranged attack or a melee attack.</text>
            <text>The effects of a martial magic spell are in addition to those normally associated with a strike in combat. If a martial artist punches a target and also performs the spell Vampiric Drain, then the target will suffer normal damage from the Punch, as well as the damage and effects from Vampiric Drain. Likewise, if a martial magician shoots a target with an arrow in conjunction with Energy Blast, then both the arrow and Energy Blast deal damage.</text>
            <text>Martial magic works similar to spellcasting, with the following notes:</text>

            <title><text>Mysticism / Psionics</text></title>
            <text>Psionics is the ability to perform magic or supernatural acts by pure force of will. No incantations, materials, or special preparation is required. A character that can perform these feats is called a Mystic.</text>
            <text>Whereas most magic users have trained to develop their abilities, Mystic characters are more often <ldquo/>gifted<rdquo/> with magical abilities. Quite often these powers manifest themselves as a result of a traumatic event, such as a near-fatal accident, that is experienced by the character. They may also be abilities that are passed down through a particular family<mdash/>in which case the character is simply born with his unique powers. Mystic characters have an innate ability to perform their abilities<mdash/>which are completely independent of any kind of structured <ldquo/>method<rdquo/> or <ldquo/>technique<rdquo/>. While mystic characters might join magical societies they cannot <ldquo/>learn<rdquo/> or <ldquo/>teach<rdquo/>mystic techniques to others. Psionic abilities are something that a mystic discovers herself.</text>

                <text>No verbal, somatic, or material components are required. A mystic can be totally still and silent and can sill use his abilities, though the time required to perform (use) a mystic ability is exactly the same as standard spellcasting.</text>

            <text>Beast Magic is a unique magic school. It is the art of summoning creatures to aid their master. Any magic user (spellcasting, ritual, etc.) may purchase summoning spells as normal. However, a spellcaster that specializes in Beast Magic (and has no other magical aptitudes) may purchase summoning spells as if they are one rank lower than normal.</text>
            <text>There are five basic summoning spells:</text>
            <description-list>
              <item>
                <description>
                  <text>Gate</text>
                </description>
                <text>allows the summoner to call forth a creature that appears somewhere near the caster. The location of appearance must be within direct line of sight of the caster, and no more than 30 feet away. Once the creature appears, it is free to do whatever it wants based on its own free willthe caster simply transports it to a new location. It will return to its original location afterrounds.</text>

                  <text>Summon</text>
                </description>
                <text>allows the summoner to call forth a creature near the caster (like Gate). This creature is bound to follow SIMPLE directives given by the caster. The creature will not act in a hostile manner towards the caster. If a summoner casts another Summon spell while another one is currently active, he must make a Magical Control roll. Failure means that the new spell fails and the first expires immediately.</text>
              </item>
              <item>
                <description>
                  <text>Pact</text>
                </description>
                <text>allows the caster to form a complex bond with a creature, making that creature his Familiar. The caster must first find a creature to use pact withsuch as summoning the creature by gate or summon) The caster maycontrolthe creature in a manner similar to summon. This is permanent and lasts until either the caster or the Familiar is slain. If the caster casts Pact a while he already has a Familiar, the original spell expires and the caster suffers. While active, the Familar is aware of what happens to the caster, and vice versa. A basic empathic link exists between the creature and the caster. The caster may make a Magical Control check in order tolisten inon any of the familiars senses at any point in time.</text>

                  <text>Control</text>
                </description>
                <text>is very similar to summon except that the caster has exacting and specific control over the creature(s) summoned. The caster can literally operate the creature(s) as though byremote control. While Control is active, the summoner is responsible for literally every action made by the summoned creatureit has no will of its own.</text>

                  <text>Transform</text>
                </description>
                <text>is a powerful technique in which the caster takes the form of the creature summoned. The caster literally becomes the creature in question, but retains his own mental state and skills in addition to the skills of the summoned creature. All physical attributes (STR, DEX, BLD) of the summoned creature replace those of the character, but the character retains his own mental attributes (INT, WIS, WIL, CHA). This effect lasts 4xturns. It cannot be ended at will. The transformation requires three actions to complete. When the spell expires, the caster will be very tired, and will suffer the effects of slow, loosing 1 action per turn forturns.</text>

It is a favorite of religious orders, either for good or evil. Most combat magic in this category is limited because the spells require touch to cast. Some spells are capable of dealing a great deal of damage, but usually over a period of time.

At lower and middle levels, physical magic allows one to improve the abilities of others, and to manipulate the physical world with magic. He can also repair broken weapons or mend machines.

          <text>Most spells automatically succeed (there is no skill check necessary, except for Faith Magic). Once cast, it is possible for some spells to miss their target however. For these spells, the player must make a skill test using Magical Control (or Faith) to determine if the strike is successful. See the spell listing for what spells are auto-targeting and which aren<rdquo/>t.</text>
          <text>If the player is interrupted while spell casting (e.g. takes damage, gets knocked around, etc.), he must make a skill check (Magical Control). If he fails the check, the spell fails, but the MP are not lost.</text>
          <note>
            <text>The caster may not speak while spellcasting, but may move around, dodge, and perform very simple physical activities.</text>

          <text>A spell always takes effect at the end of the casting period. The MP are consumed at the exact instant that the spell takes effect.</text>
          <text>A casting time of zero (0) means that the caster may cast the spell anytime, even in response to something (e.g. getting shot at), or having no actions remaining at the time. Such spells require no command words, components, or gesturing of any kind.</text>

            <title><text>Magical <ldquo/>Tools<rdquo/>: Books, Scrolls, and Potions</text></title>
            <text>There exist three different kinds of magic-related books.</text>
            <text>Type 1 is a volume that contains detailed information on how to cast a particular spell (or spells). Books of this type are always written in magical script. Anyone with the Magical Studies skill can read and understand this kind of book. However, only those with Spellcasting can make real use of the contents. A Spellcasting character can easily learn new spells from a book of this type. Books of this type are very valuable. The cost of a spell book like this is equal to the <ldquo/>Book<rdquo/> price column of the magic table. If the book contains multiple spells, then its value is equal to the sum of the costs for each spell contained. Generally speaking, books of this type only contain multiple spells when they are compendia of low-level spells in a given school of magic.</text>
            <text>Type 2 is a volume that describes how to perform a particular spell in ritual format. Books of this type might be written in any language, and are generally not written in magical script. If a Ritual magic using character can read a book of this type, it is something like a cookbook for a particular ritual spell. The character could keep the book as a reference or could use it to learn the ritual described. Ritual spell manuals are worth approximately one-quarter the cost of a Type 1 book.</text>
            <text>Type 3 is a book that describes other forms of magic. Since Faith magic, Martial Magic, and Mysticism are dependant on the individual <ldquo/>casting<rdquo/> the spell and not on some external <ldquo/>formula<rdquo/> or <ldquo/>recipe<rdquo/>, it is essentially impossible to truly document how to perform a given spell with nothing more than a book. These books are of interest to sages and scholars who are interested in arcane subjects. However, they are little more than a curiosity to actual practitioners of magic. Given enough books of this type it is possible for a sufficiently advanced magical practitioner to figure out a new spell or technique, but it is no guarantee. Books of this type are worth approximatley one-tenth of the listed price, depending on the exact subject matter contained within the volume. They may be written in any language.</text>
            <text>Magical potions or scrolls are single-use magic spells. Anybody can use a potion or scroll<mdash/>whether they know anything about magic or not. Spells that affect the caster or a willing recipient are potions. Drinking the potion causes the spell to take effect. Other spells take the form of scrolls. Reading the scroll aloud causes the spell to take effect. Both scrolls and potions are single-use only. Potions can be drunk in one action. Scrolls ALWAYS take 3 actions to use regardless of the spell.</text>
            <text>A person with Magical Studies can create Books, Scrolls, and Potions of any spell he/she knows. Producing such works is a long and expensive process:</text>

                <text>spells are those associated with evil, death energy, and demonic influence. While they are not necissiarily evil, they are generally indescriminate in their targets. Black spells never affect demons, undead, or targets that are not living, such as ghosts or robots.</text>

          <title><text>Rules</text></title>
          <text>Martial Arts covers the use of all weapons (ranged, melee, ultratech, mecha, et al.), in addition to hand-to-hand (HtH) combat, and the set of specialized skills that are associated with the Martial Arts governing skill. The maximum level that any character may have in any Martial Arts skill is less than or equal to his level in Martial Arts, i.e. if he has 3 Levels in Martial Arts, then all of his Martial Arts skills must be Level 3 or less. The basic Martial Art skill confers upon the martial artist the ability to purchase the different skills listed in this section.</text>
          <text>For each level the martial artist has in Martial Arts they may choose one Martial Arts skill; for this skill, any time the martial artist would have to roll the skill, they get an extra die to do so. A skill may only be chosen Level-in-Martial Arts/2 times (the Lvl in Martial Arts, divided by two, rounded-down).</text>
          <example>
            <title><text>Kim improves his Nyrkkeily</text></title>
            <text>Kim NGoc Goay is an expert in Norse Boxing (Nyrkkeily), he chooses, when he gets his first level in Martial Arts, he also buys a level in <ldquo/>Punch/Kick;<rdquo/> in particular, he also assigns his level-bonus to <ldquo/>Punch/Kick.<rdquo/> This means when he rolls to strike with a punch he rolls two dice and not one.</text>
          </example>
          <text>After the Martial Arts skill has been purchased, skills from the four basic categories may be acquired; the four categories represent different capabilities that Martial Arts covers. The five categories are Basic, Combat, Defensive, and Modifier. The different categories focus on different phases of Combat, such that Combat skills are designed to aid the Martial Artist with movement, entering/exiting combat, the knowledge of combat, deployment, and higher-level strategy. Basic skills are involved in the nitty-gritty (basic) postures and moves to actually strike the opponent and inflict harm or death. Defensive skills are designed to deflect, dodge, and/or otherwise avoid the mishap of being harmed by another pugilist. Modifiers represent ways to modify Basic skills.</text>

              <text>These skills represent Basic combat actions, such as punching or kicking, grappling, the use of weapons and other primitive attacks.</text>
              <note>

                <text>Modifier</text>
              </description>
              <text>A Modifier is a skill used to modify a Basic attack. A Modifier changes the behaviour of a Basic attack; the Basic attack is now considered a Special attack of the same name with the Modifier as the adjective, for instance, if the Martial Artist is modifying a Punch with a Bash, then this is now a Special attack,Bashing Punch.Since a modified Basic attack counts as a Special attack, it may not be further modified, as only Basic attacks can be modified. There are certain Combat skills which enable the Martial Artist to consider certain specific combinations of Modifier/Basic to be Basic attacks.</text>
            </item>
          </description-list>
          <note>
            <text>A Modifier may not be used more than Lvl times per turn.</text>
          </note>
          <example>
            <title><text>Candlestick modifies his punch</text></title>
            <text>Candlestick has three levels in Martial Arts; he has bought Punch at rank 3 and level 3, and chosen it as his bonus; he also has Bash at level 1 and Feint at level 1. He is striking at the Giant Hispaniola Solenodon with a Bashing Punch. Because he is using Bash with his Punch his punch is now considered <ldquo/>special<rdquo/> and may not be further modified, even though he could still use his Feint this turn.</text>

          <title><text>Further Commentary</text></title>
          <text>You will note that there is no <ldquo/>chi<rdquo/> or <ldquo/>super-powers<rdquo/> in Martial Arts. In fact, the skills are deliberately kept pedestrian<mdash/>those possessed (or assumed to be possessed, if possible) by the greatest <ldquo/>non-mystical<rdquo/>martial artists in the<lsquo/>real world.<rdquo/> This is done deliberately to provide a clear separation between the Supernormal<mdash/>governed by Magic and Traits<mdash/>and the mundane reality of kicking, spitting, biting and hurting. If you want to create a character that has truly jaw-dropping magical abilities, like flying-through the air, or punching through a fired-brick wall, bending steel, or leaping from roof-top-to-roof-top, consider looking into the Magic and Traits section. In Magic there a several categories that would benefit a Martial Artist tremondously.</text>
          <section kind="section">
            <title><text>Advanced Martial Arts</text></title>
            <text>Also there are several para-skills which are tremondously important to the dedicated Martial Artist: Kata, Kung Fu, Waza, and Jitsu. These skills allow the Martial Artist to transform his very Basic and Defensive attacks, allowing him to perform prodigious feats: a Savage Feinting Death Strike is only possible by using these skills.</text>

          <text>A robot in which the pilot is completely protected by armor and other mechanisms.Mecha are controlled by abstract means and requires the Mecha Piloting skill.</text>
          <text>Mecha denotes armored mechanical vehicles that are built in the form of a human. There are two basic types of mecha: Power Armor and Mecha.</text>
          <text>Power Armor is an armored suit that is <ldquo/>worn<rdquo/> like clothing. It provides armor protection, but it has the function of increasing the wearer<rsquo/>s strength, endurance, and weapon payload. It is easy to use. The internal computers, etc, in the suit allow it to follow the wearer<rsquo/>s movements.</text>
          <itemized-list>
            <item>
              <text>Power Armor does NOT require any skill to use</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text>Power Armor must be either the same size as the wearer, or exactly one level larger</text>
            </item>
          </itemized-list>
          <text>True Mecha is best thought of as a vehicle, like an airplane or tank, which is often bipedal. Mecha is piloted, not worn like power armor. A mecha has a cockpit, and is controlled with levers, switches, and pedals. Piloting a mecha is something like flying an airplane or driving a car.</text>
          <itemized-list>
            <item>
              <text>The Mecha Piloting skill is required to operate a mecha</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text>When piloting a mech, any skill you use is capped at your level of mecha piloting. So, if you had LVL 5 Dodge, but have a Mecha Piloting skill of 4, you would roll 4 dice to dodge in your mech.</text>
            </item>
            <item>
              <text>Mecha must be AT LEAST one size level larger than the pilot. Beyond that, they can be ANY size.</text>
            </item>
          </itemized-list>
          <text>As a general summary: Power Armor tends to be a lighter and smaller than mecha. Power Armor can carry less weaponry (and other hardware), but is usually more manueverable. It is often possible to perform major feats of dexterity while wearing power armor. This is because the power armor does not hinder the wearer<rsquo/>s natural skills. As well, power armor is easier to use because the Mecha Piloting skill is not required.</text>
          <text>Mecha tend to be larger and more powerful than power armor. Mecha generally have more and heavier weapons, better armor, and superior auxiliary systems compared to powered armor. However, the pilot needs to be skilled to maximize the potential of a mecha.</text>

                <text>The number of HP and Slots that a mecha has can be further altered by the internal frame<rsquo/>s style and material makup. Frame Style determines the efficiency of how bulky the internal frame of the mecha is, this adjusts the number of slots that are within the mecha. Frame Material is the makeup of the frame, what it is made of. Different materials offer decreased or added hit points to the mecha. Choose the type of Frame Style, as well as the Material. Cross reference them on the chart below, and multiply the number by the size of the mecha to get the CP cost for that configuration.</text>
                <text>For example, if you chose a <ldquo/>Light Matrix Composite<rdquo/> frame for a size 4 mecha, it will receive -10<percent/>to it<rsquo/>s slot total, would gain +60<percent/>to it<rsquo/>s hit points, and cost 16 CP (size of 4*4).</text>
                <text>If a mecha suit runs out of HP, it is rendered useless until repaired. If it goes -HP then it is destroyed. Any time the mecha takes 10<percent/>of it<rsquo/>s total HP in one blow, the pilot takes <roll><num>1</num><face>6</face><bOff>+</bOff><bns>1</bns><kind>U</kind></roll> damage.</text>

                <text>Various parts of a mecha or powered suit require power to operate. This can come from any number of different sources. A mecha will generally have an ENGINE of some sort that supplies power for moving around, and operating equipment <and/> weapons. Some mecha will have supplimentary power sources used for especially power-hungry equipment. All power sources take up slots within the suit based on the amount of power that it produces. The more expensive (in CP) a power system is, the more power can be gotten from one slot<rsquo/>s worth of the power source. Power is measured in PCs (or Power Cells). All power sources produce the number of listed PC at the beginning of each of the character<rsquo/>s turns. All systems on a suit will draw power from this, and if there isn<rdquo/>t enough power available, that piece of equipment will not function. So it is vital that the suit has adequate power.</text>

            <text>Energy weapons draw energy straight from the engines or batteries. There are multiple different methods for producing the blast that comes from an energy weapon, but all of them share some things in common. First, the base damage-table is used to calculate the damage an energy weapon does based on it<rsquo/>s class:</text>
