The Monofilament Whip is length of metallic, diamondoid, or silicoid wire that is the thickness of a single molecule, with a weight on one end.	The Archaic Weapon - Chain skill is used.  A skill roll of 4 or less is considered a critical failure (instead of the normal 1). This modified critical failure is there for people who are skilled.  Those who are not get a critical failure on a 9 or below.

The recover time of the Monofilament Whip cannot be reduced by strength, and will always require a 1 action to recover from safely. The user can attempt to reduce the recover time to 0, but there is a 50\% chance that the user will strike himself with the	whip dealing full damage to himself.
