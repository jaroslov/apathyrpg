The Apathy system relies on a description of all the parts in a subset (variant) of XHTML. This means that all of the data for the entire system is stored in a number of XHTML documents. The build system takes these XHTML documents and combines them together, performing a number of transformations and then builds a web page or a TeX document from the input values.
