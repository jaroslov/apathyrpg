= Introduction =

The Apathy system relies on a description of all the parts in a subset (variant) of XHTML. This means that all of the data for the entire system is stored in a number of XHTML documents. The build system takes these XHTML documents and combines them together, performing a number of transformations and then builds a web page or a TeX document from the input values.

= Breaking the Build: Content =

You should _always_ open your content in an XML validating structured editor or viewer, such as Firefox, before committing. This reduces the chances of build-breakage.

  # Always update your repository before beginning to edit content
  # Before checking content in, open it up in Firefox and fix any error messages
  # Always check your modified content in as soon as possible

= Boom! Microformat =

We will eventually be moving to the Boom! microformat and developing an @page CSS style for Apathy. Our hope is that this will enable us to move away from the latex and lxml dependencies, and to a pure Python+XHTML tool-chain.
