    A legal ApathyRPG document must begin with the XML tag
    
    However, first we need to define the book. The root "div" element in this document is given
    the attribute `class' with the value "book", which can only occur once within a book. This
    is the root element of the entire book. A `book' contains two parts: the first is the
    title-page information, the second is a "div" element with an attribute `class' whose 
    value must be "section-body".
    
    To simplify life (and reduce the potential size of files), we split the document into
    pieces. We do this by replacing the content with an anchor (a) element with the
    attribute `class' whose value is "in-place". The ApathyRPG will find the document
    named in the attribute `href' and place the contents of that document in place of the
    anchor element.
    
    The section body of a book contains only content.
